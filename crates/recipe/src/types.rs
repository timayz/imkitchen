//! Recipe domain types for meal planning enhancements
//!
//! This module contains enum types introduced in Epic 6: Enhanced Meal Planning System
//! to support accompaniment pairing, cuisine tracking, and dietary filtering.

/// Accompaniment category for recipe pairing
///
/// Defines the category of side dishes that can accompany main courses.
/// Main courses specify which accompaniment categories they accept via `preferred_accompaniments`.
/// Accompaniment recipes specify their category via `accompaniment_category`.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use recipe::AccompanimentCategory;
///
/// let tikka_masala_preferences = vec![
///     AccompanimentCategory::Rice,
///     AccompanimentCategory::Pasta,
/// ];

    /// Salad sides (green salad, coleslaw, etc.)
    Salad,
    /// Bread sides (garlic bread, naan, baguette, etc.)
    Bread,

/// Cuisine type for recipe categorization and variety tracking
///
/// Supports 13 predefined cuisines plus a Custom variant for user-defined cuisines.
/// The meal planning algorithm uses cuisine to ensure variety across weekly meal plans
/// (avoid repeating the same cuisine too frequently).

/// # Example
/// ```
/// use recipe::Cuisine;
///
/// let indian = Cuisine::Indian;
/// let fusion = Cuisine::Custom("Fusion".to_string());

/// Dietary tag for recipe filtering and user constraint matching
///
/// Describes dietary properties of recipes (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.).
/// The meal planning algorithm filters recipes where all user dietary restrictions
/// match the recipe's dietary tags.
