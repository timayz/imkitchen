# askama template best practices
- Always use proper Askama templates with #[derive(Template)] instead of inline HTML generation with format!()
- Use double quotes for string comparisons in templates (e.g., {% if complexity == "simple" %})
- Avoid reserved Rust keywords in template struct fields (e.g., use toast_type instead of type)
- Templates should be placed in templates/components/ for reusable components and templates/pages/ for full pages
