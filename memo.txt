# init milestones / issues from epic
can you create all epics as milestone with associeted stories as issue ? epic title format
  "v0.{epic_num}", issue title format "{story_title}" with label story.

I want to add multi language support. Can you replace all texts in templates/index.html, like 'My text' by '{{ "My test"|t }}' ?
then I want you to add them to fr.json like { "My test": "Mon test", "My test 2": "Mon test 2" }. Do not add duplicate transalation.
