## Description, Context and Goals

### Description

imkitchen is an intelligent meal planning and cooking optimization platform designed to eliminate the mental overhead and timing complexity that prevents home cooks from exploring their full recipe repertoire. The platform transforms cooking from a stressful daily decision into an effortless, enjoyable experience through three core capabilities:

**1. Intelligent Automation** - Multi-factor optimization algorithm that automatically generates a single meal plan with aggregate recipes organized by week. The system matches recipe complexity to user availability, energy patterns, and schedule constraints while considering advance preparation requirements, ingredient freshness windows, equipment conflicts, and real-time disruptions to create realistic, achievable weekly schedules.

**2. Preparation Orchestration** - Detailed morning reminders with specific timing guidance for advance preparation tasks (marination, rising, chilling, defrosting). Users receive actionable notifications that break down complex multi-day recipes into manageable steps, ensuring they can successfully execute recipes that would otherwise require complex mental planning.

**3. Community-Driven Discovery** - Social recipe sharing and rating system that enables users to discover tested, high-quality recipes from other home cooks. Community feedback creates trust signals that help users confidently expand their culinary repertoire beyond their current comfort zone.

**Primary Value Proposition:** imkitchen unlocks access to complex recipes by automating timing, preparation, and scheduling complexity, enabling home cooks to utilize their full recipe collections without the planning burden that currently forces artificial self-limitation.

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** Home cooking enthusiasts (ages 28-45, families, $50K+ income) who save 50+ recipes but cook only 10-15 regularly due to planning complexity
- **Secondary:** Busy professional families (ages 32-50, dual-income, 1-3 children) seeking to reduce takeout reliance while maintaining family dinner traditions

**Core Problem Solved:** Home cooks artificially limit their recipe choices to avoid advance preparation timing complexity, resulting in culinary monotony and underutilized recipe collections. Current meal planning solutions address recipe storage and basic scheduling but ignore the fundamental timing coordination problem that drives user self-limitation.

**Business Model:** Freemium SaaS with 10 recipe limit in free tier, premium features include unlimited recipes, advanced scheduling optimization, and priority community features. Target 10,000 active users within 6 months, 15% premium conversion within 60 days.

### Deployment Intent

Production SaaS with freemium business model. Target launch with MVP feature set to early adopters, then scale to 10,000 active users within 6 months. Platform designed for high availability, mobile-first progressive web app experience with offline capabilities. Premium tier unlocks unlimited recipes and advanced scheduling features, targeting 15% conversion rate within 60 days of user signup.

### Context

Home cooks face a fundamental tension between culinary variety and planning simplicity. Despite maintaining extensive recipe collections—often 50+ saved recipes across bookmarks, apps, and cookbooks—users repeatedly cook only 10-15 simple dishes. This artificial self-limitation stems not from lack of skill or interest, but from the overwhelming complexity of coordinating advance preparation timing, ingredient freshness windows, and family schedules. Current meal planning applications focus on recipe storage and basic calendar scheduling but fail to address the core friction: the mental overhead required to successfully execute recipes with multi-day preparation requirements. This creates a pattern where users avoid complex but rewarding recipes entirely, resulting in culinary stagnation despite expanded cooking time at home.

The timing is optimal for intelligent meal planning automation. Post-2020, families cook 40% more meals at home, creating both increased demand for cooking solutions and heightened frustration with planning complexity. Users demonstrate willingness to adopt complex systems when they deliver demonstrable time savings and reduce decision fatigue. The convergence of mobile-first design patterns, progressive web app capabilities for offline kitchen access, and sophisticated scheduling algorithms enables a solution that eliminates timing complexity while maintaining user control and culinary creativity. The market gap is clear: existing solutions treat meal planning as a scheduling problem when it is fundamentally a timing orchestration challenge requiring intelligent automation that matches recipe complexity to user capacity.

### Goals

1. **User Acquisition & Retention**: Achieve 10,000 monthly active users within 6 months of launch with 70% weekly active user retention rate, demonstrating strong product-market fit.

2. **Recipe Variety Expansion**: Enable users to cook 3x more unique recipes per month compared to pre-app baseline, validating that intelligent automation successfully unlocks culinary repertoire expansion.

3. **Planning Efficiency**: Reduce user meal planning time by 60% while maintaining 85% recipe completion rate, proving the platform delivers measurable time savings without sacrificing execution quality.

4. **Community Engagement**: Achieve 40% monthly recipe rating participation and build library of 500+ community-rated recipes within first year, creating sustainable content network effects.

5. **Revenue Generation**: Reach $50,000 monthly recurring revenue by month 12 with 15% free-to-premium conversion within 60 days, validating freemium business model viability.

   - Homemade Pizza automatically rescheduled by algorithm to next week

**Pain Point Resolved:**
- Avoided takeout reliance through quick adaptation
- Maintained meal plan integrity without re-planning entire week
- Shopping list stayed synchronized with meal changes

## UX Design Principles

1. **Kitchen-First Design**
   - All interfaces optimized for kitchen environment use: large touch targets (44x44px minimum), high contrast for varied lighting, spill-resistant interaction patterns avoiding hover states, and hands-free voice control compatibility for when hands are messy.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Display only essential information at each step, revealing complexity gradually as needed. Dashboard shows today's meals and primary actions; detailed recipe steps expand only when cooking; advanced settings hidden behind progressive menus. Minimize cognitive load during high-stress cooking moments.

3. **Trust Through Transparency**
   - Always explain automated decisions to build user confidence in intelligent scheduling. Show why meal was assigned to specific day ("Saturday: more prep time available"), indicate advance preparation timing rationale, and surface algorithm constraints in human-readable language. Users trust systems they understand.

4. **Instant Feedback and Confirmation**
   - Provide immediate visual confirmation for all user actions. Recipe saved → green checkmark animation. Meal replaced → calendar updates in real-time. Shopping list item tapped → strike-through with haptic feedback. Eliminate user uncertainty about system state.

5. **Graceful Failure Recovery**
   - When things go wrong, offer immediate solutions rather than error messages. Can't generate meal plan → suggest adding more recipes with "Add Recipe" button. Network unavailable → show cached content with sync indicator. Failed payment → inline retry with alternative payment method option.

6. **Contextual Intelligence**
   - Adapt interface based on user context and behavior patterns. Morning: highlight today's prep reminders. Evening: emphasize tonight's cooking steps. Commute time detected: offer quick meal replacement options. Learn from usage patterns to anticipate needs.

7. **Minimize Input Friction**
   - Reduce manual data entry through smart defaults, autocomplete, and progressive enhancement. Recipe entry suggests common ingredient units, auto-categorizes ingredients, and learns user's frequently used items. Profile preferences inferred from early behavior and refined through usage.

8. **Unified Visual Language**
   - Maintain consistent design system across entire application: standardized spacing (8px grid), cohesive typography hierarchy (headers, body, captions), predictable color semantics (green = success, yellow = prep required, red = urgent), and reusable component patterns ensuring users feel immersed in unified experience.

9. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**
   - Design for smallest screen first, progressively enhancing for larger displays. Critical features accessible within thumb reach on mobile, desktop utilizes additional space for side-by-side recipe/instructions view, tablet optimized for kitchen counter propping with landscape orientation support.

10. **Celebration of Success**
   - Acknowledge and celebrate user achievements to reinforce positive behavior. First meal plan generated → congratulations animation. Week completed → recipe variety metrics visualization. New recipe tried → community sharing prompt. Make progress visible and rewarding to drive engagement.

## Next Steps

### For Architecture Phase (Immediate)

**Level 3 projects require architect handoff before story generation.** Start new context window with architect role and provide:

1. **This PRD:** `./docs/PRD.md`
2. **Epic Breakdown:** `./docs/epics.md` (50 stories across 5 epics: Epic 1-5)
3. **Product Brief:** `./docs/brief.md`
4. **Project Analysis:** `./docs/project-workflow-analysis.md`

**Ask architect to:**
- Run architecture workflow (3-solutioning)
- Design event-sourced architecture using evento with DDD bounded contexts
- Create database schema (SQLite with SQLx, event store + read models)
- Define HTML endpoints and form handling (TwinSpark progressive enhancement, not REST API)
- Design CQRS query projections from event stream for Askama template rendering
- Create technical-decisions.md capturing technology choices
- Generate architecture.md with system diagrams

### Subsequent Planning Steps

**After Architecture Complete:**

1. **UX Specification** (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for UI-heavy systems)
   - Run: workflow plan-project → select "UX specification"
   - Input: PRD.md, epics.md, architecture.md
   - Output: ux-specification.md with IA, user flows, component library
   - Optional: Generate AI Frontend Prompt for rapid prototyping

2. **Detailed Story Generation**
   - Command: workflow generate-stories (future workflow)
   - Input: epics.md + architecture.md + ux-specification.md
   - Output: user-stories.md with full acceptance criteria and technical implementation details

3. **Technical Design Documents**
   - Database schema finalization with migrations
   - HTML endpoint specification (routes, form handling, TwinSpark actions)
   - Integration point documentation (SMTP, payment gateway, push notifications)

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test approach per domain crate (TDD enforced)
   - Integration test plan (evento aggregate behavior, HTTP endpoints)
   - E2E test scenarios (Playwright: registration, meal planning, shopping list flows)
   - Property-based testing for meal planning algorithm invariants

### Development Preparation

**Before Implementation:**

1. **Set up development environment**
   - Repository structure with Cargo workspaces
   - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar)
   - Development tools (cargo-watch, cargo-tarpaulin, Playwright)
   - Testing infrastructure (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Observability stack (OpenTelemetry)
   - Database migrations and deployment configuration

2. **Create sprint plan**
   - **Epic 1 first** (8 stories): Authentication enables all subsequent features
   - **Epics 2-3** (22 stories combined): Recipe management + meal planning deliver core value
   - **Epics 4-5** (20 stories combined): Shopping/prep + PWA complete MVP experience
   - **Total: 50 stories across 5-8 months**

3. **Establish monitoring and metrics**
   - Success metrics from PRD (3x recipe variety, 60% planning time reduction)
   - Technical monitoring (OpenTelemetry, logs, traces, metrics)
   - User analytics (funnel tracking, engagement metrics)

### Validation Checkpoints

- [ ] Architecture reviewed and approved
- [ ] Database schema supports event sourcing and read models
- [ ] HTML endpoint design reviewed for security and TwinSpark integration
- [ ] UX specification ensures cohesive user experience
- [ ] Technical stack validated against constraints (no vendor lock-in, OWASP compliance)
- [ ] Development timeline confirmed (6-9 months to MVP)

## Document Status

- [ ] Goals and context validated with stakeholders
- [ ] All functional requirements reviewed
