## Summary

### Timeline Overview

| Phase | Duration | Tasks | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------|------------------|
| Phase 1: Database & Domain | 2 weeks | 5 tasks | Schema migration, domain models, events |
| Phase 2: Algorithm | 2 weeks | 8 tasks | Multi-week generation, preferences, accompaniments |
| Phase 3: Backend Routes | 1 week | 7 tasks | All API endpoints, handlers |
| Phase 4: Frontend UX | 2 weeks | 8 tasks | Calendar, forms, preferences, Tailwind 4.1+ |
| Phase 5: Testing | 1 week | 4 tasks | E2E, performance, accessibility, bug fixes |
| Phase 6: Deployment | 1 week | 6 tasks | Staging, production, monitoring, docs |
| **Total** | **9 weeks** | **38 tasks** | Full feature set deployed |

### Resource Allocation

- **Backend Developers:** 2 developers (Phases 1-3, 5)
- **Frontend Developer:** 1 developer (Phase 4, 5)
- **DevOps Engineer:** 1 engineer (Phase 6)
- **QA Engineer:** 1 engineer (Phase 5)
- **Product Manager / Technical Writer:** 1 person (Phase 6)

### Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Areas:**
1. **Algorithm performance** - Mitigated by early benchmarking (Phase 2)
2. **Database migration** - Mitigated by staging testing + rollback plan
3. **User adoption** - Mitigated by clear onboarding and documentation

**Contingency:**
- Add 1-2 week buffer for unforeseen issues
- Phased rollout option: Deploy features incrementally if needed

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this implementation plan** with technical leads
2. **Create Jira/Linear tickets** from tasks above
3. **Assign team members** to phases
4. **Kick off Phase 1** (Database & Domain Foundation)
5. **Weekly standups** to track progress

**Status:** âœ… Ready for Team Review
