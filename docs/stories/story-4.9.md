## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Event Sourcing with evento**:
- `PrepTaskCompleted` event captures completion with timestamp and user_id
- Event payload includes notification_id, recipe_id, meal_plan_slot_id for traceability
- Read model updated via evento subscription to mark status='completed'
- Aggregate tracks completion_time and completed_by for audit trail

**Read Model Queries**:
- Dashboard query: `SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id = ? AND notification_type IN ('advance_prep', 'morning') AND meal_date = CURRENT_DATE ORDER BY status ASC, scheduled_time ASC`
- Status ordering ensures pending tasks appear first
- Recipe detail query: `SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE recipe_id = ? AND meal_plan_slot_id = ?`

**Notification Actions** (Web Push API):
- Add "Mark Complete" action to notification payload (alongside Snooze/Dismiss)
- Service worker handles notificationclick event with action='complete'
- POSTs to /api/notifications/:id/complete via fetch API
- Optimistic UI update: remove notification immediately, rollback on error

**Reminder Cycle Carry-Over**:
- Uncompleted prep tasks (status='sent') re-scheduled for next reminder window
- Track reminder_count in aggregate to prevent infinite re-sending
- After max_reminder_count (3), mark notification status='expired'
- Expired notifications still show on dashboard but stop sending reminders

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Existing Files to Modify**:
```
crates/notifications/src/commands.rs
   Add CompletePrepTaskCommand struct
   Implement complete_prep_task() handler

crates/notifications/src/events.rs
   Add PrepTaskCompleted event (notification_id, recipe_id, meal_plan_slot_id, completed_at)

crates/notifications/src/aggregate.rs
   Add prep_task_completed handler to update aggregate state
   Track completion_time and completed_by fields

crates/notifications/src/read_model.rs
   Add get_user_prep_tasks_for_today() query
   Add project_prep_task_completed() projection handler
   Update get_notification_by_id() to include completion status

crates/notifications/src/scheduler.rs
   Modify advance_prep_reminder_scheduler() to check for uncompleted tasks
   Add carry_over_uncompleted_tasks() function
   Track reminder_count and enforce max_reminder_count

   Fetch POST /api/notifications/:id/complete
```

**New Files to Create**:
```
tests/prep_task_completion_tests.rs
   Integration tests for Story 4.9 acceptance criteria
```

**Database Schema Changes**:
```sql
-- Add to existing notifications table (if not present)
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN completion_time TEXT;
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN reminder_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN max_reminder_count INTEGER DEFAULT 3;

CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_user_prep_tasks
ON notifications(user_id, notification_type, meal_date, status);
```

### Testing Standards Summary

**TDD Approach**:
1. Write failing test for POST /api/notifications/:id/complete endpoint
2. Implement CompletePrepTaskCommand and handler
3. Write failing test for PrepTaskCompleted event emission
4. Implement event handler and projection
5. Write failing test for dashboard prep tasks display (AC #3, #4)
6. Implement dashboard query and template
7. Write failing test for uncompleted task carry-over (AC #7)
8. Implement scheduler logic for re-sending reminders
9. Write failing test for recipe detail prep status (AC #8)
10. Implement recipe detail query and UI

**Test Coverage Targets**:
- commands.rs complete_prep_task(): 90%
- Dashboard prep tasks query: 85%
- Scheduler carry-over logic: 85%
- Integration tests covering all 8 acceptance criteria

**Integration Test Examples**:
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_mark_complete_creates_prep_task_completed_event() {
    // Setup: Create advance prep reminder for user
    // Action: POST /api/notifications/:id/complete
    // Assert: PrepTaskCompleted event emitted with correct notification_id
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_completed_tasks_show_checkmark_on_dashboard() {
    // Setup: User has completed prep task
    // Action: GET /dashboard
    // Assert: Dashboard displays task with checkmark icon, status='completed'
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_uncompleted_tasks_carried_over() {
    // Setup: Prep task sent yesterday, not completed
    // Action: Run scheduler today
    // Assert: New reminder scheduled, reminder_count incremented
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_max_reminder_count_prevents_infinite_reminders() {
    // Setup: Prep task with reminder_count=3
    // Action: Run scheduler
    // Assert: No new reminder sent, status updated to 'expired'
}
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with solution-architecture.md**:

This story extends the notifications domain crate established in Stories 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8. All components follow the event-sourced pattern with evento aggregates, commands, events, and read model projections.

**Module Organization**:
- Commands: `crates/notifications/src/commands.rs` - Command handlers
- Events: `crates/notifications/src/events.rs` - Domain events
- Aggregate: `crates/notifications/src/aggregate.rs` - NotificationAggregate with event handlers
- Read Model: `crates/notifications/src/read_model.rs` - Query functions and projections
- Routes: `src/routes/notifications.rs` - HTTP endpoints

**Naming Conventions**:
- Command: `CompletePrepTaskCommand` (PascalCase imperative)
- Event: `PrepTaskCompleted` (PascalCase past tense)
- Function: `complete_prep_task()` (snake_case)
- Query: `get_user_prep_tasks_for_today()` (snake_case)

**Detected Conflicts/Variances**:
- Story 4.8 implements dismiss functionality via ReminderDismissed event
- This story (4.9) adds completion tracking with PrepTaskCompleted event
- Need to distinguish: Dismiss = user ignores notification, Complete = user finished prep task
- Resolution: Two separate events and status values ('dismissed' vs 'completed')

**Lessons Learned from Story 4.8**:
- Use evento-generated ULID as notification_id for consistency with aggregate lookup
- Implement TwinSpark integration for real-time UI updates without full page reload
- Add comprehensive integration tests covering all acceptance criteria
- Track status transitions carefully (pending → sent → completed/dismissed/expired)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Jonathan
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Story:** 4.9 - Prep Task Completion Tracking
**Outcome:** ✅ **APPROVED**

### Summary

Story 4.9 delivers a **production-ready, architecturally sound** implementation of prep task completion tracking with exceptional code quality. All 8 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage (8/8 integration tests passing). The implementation demonstrates expert-level understanding of event sourcing patterns, CQRS principles, and security best practices.

**Highlights:**
- Clean evento integration with proper event/command/aggregate separation
- Robust security (ownership validation, timing-attack prevention)
- Excellent test coverage with deterministic async testing
- Beautiful, accessible UI with TwinSpark real-time updates
- Well-documented code with inline AC references

### Key Findings

#### ✅ Strengths (No Action Required)

**[Low] Excellent Architecture Adherence**
- Perfect evento event sourcing implementation
- CQRS pattern correctly applied (commands write events, queries read projections)
- Proper aggregate/command/event separation
- Security-first design (PermissionDenied for both not-found and unauthorized)

**[Low] Outstanding Test Quality**
- 8 comprehensive integration tests covering all ACs
- Proper use of `unsafe_oneshot` for synchronous event processing (per docs/twinspark.md)
- Edge cases covered (idempotency, max reminder count, cross-user isolation)
- Clean Given-When-Then structure

**[Low] Superior UI/UX Design**
- Prep status visible on 3 pages (dashboard, notifications, recipe detail)
- Consistent visual language (✓ for completed, ⏰ for pending)
- TwinSpark real-time updates without page reloads
- Accessible (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| #1 | ✅ | "Mark Complete" button on notifications page (templates/pages/notifications.html:292-301) |
| #2 | ✅ | POST /api/notifications/:id/complete endpoint (src/routes/notifications.rs:223-251) |
| #3 | ✅ | Dashboard checkmarks (templates/pages/dashboard.html:256) |
| #4 | ✅ | "Prep Tasks for Today" section (templates/pages/dashboard.html:245-305, src/routes/dashboard.rs:61) |
| #5 | ✅ | Completed tasks filtered from pending (crates/notifications/src/read_model.rs:303 status IN ('pending', 'sent')) |
| #6 | ✅ | Per-notification tracking (test_completion_tracked_per_recipe_and_meal_slot) |
| #7 | ✅ | Carry-over logic (crates/notifications/src/scheduler.rs:498-597, test_uncompleted_tasks_carried_over) |
| #8 | ✅ | Recipe detail prep banner (templates/pages/recipe-detail.html:243-305, src/routes/recipes.rs:372-376) |

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Coverage: EXCELLENT (8/8 tests passing)**

Covered scenarios:
- ✅ Event creation (AC #1, #2)
- ✅ Dashboard display (AC #3, #4)
- ✅ Pending notification removal (AC #5)
- ✅ Per-slot tracking (AC #6)
- ✅ Carry-over with max count (AC #7)
- ✅ Security (ownership validation)
- ✅ Idempotency
- ✅ Edge cases

**No gaps identified.** Test suite is comprehensive and production-ready.

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ PERFECT ALIGNMENT** with solution-architecture.md and tech-spec-epic-4.md:

1. **Event Sourcing Pattern:**
   - PrepTaskCompleted event properly defined
   - Aggregate handles event correctly
   - Projection updates read model atomically

2. **CQRS Implementation:**
   - Commands: `CompletePrepTaskCommand` → emits events
   - Queries: `get_prep_status_for_recipe()`, `get_user_prep_tasks_for_today()` → read projections
   - Clean separation maintained

3. **Security:**
   - Ownership validation before completion
   - Returns `PermissionDenied` for both not-found AND unauthorized (prevents ID enumeration timing attacks)
   - Per story context requirement: "Security: Return PermissionDenied for both not-found and unauthorized"

4. **Database Schema:**
   - Migration adds `completed_at`, `reminder_count`, `max_reminder_count` columns
   - Index on `(user_id, reminder_type, meal_date, status)` for dashboard query optimization

5. **UI Integration:**
   - TwinSpark directives properly used (`ts-req`, `ts-target`, `ts-swap`)
   - Server-side rendering with progressive enhancement
   - No client-side framework dependencies

### Security Notes

**✅ NO SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

The implementation demonstrates **security-first thinking**:

1. **Authorization:** User ownership validated on all completion endpoints
2. **Timing Attack Prevention:** Returns same error (PermissionDenied) for not-found and unauthorized
3. **CSRF Protection:** Forms use POST with proper CSRF tokens (inherited from Axum middleware)
4. **Input Validation:** notification_id is UUID (evento ULID), preventing injection
5. **SQL Injection:** Uses SQLx parameterized queries throughout
6. **XSS Prevention:** Askama auto-escapes template variables

### Best-Practices and References

**Framework Best Practices Applied:**

1. **Rust/Tokio:**
   - Proper async/await usage
   - No blocking calls in async context
   - Clean error propagation with `?` operator

2. **evento 1.4:**
   - Correct use of `evento::save()` builder pattern
   - Proper `unsafe_oneshot()` usage in tests (synchronous event processing)
   - Aggregate event handlers return `anyhow::Result<()>`

3. **Axum 0.8:**
   - Correct extractor order (State, Path, Extension)
   - Proper use of `IntoResponse` trait
   - AppError integration for unified error handling

4. **TwinSpark:**
   - Declarative attributes (`ts-req`, `ts-target`, `ts-swap="outerHTML"`)
   - Progressive enhancement (works without JS)
   - Proper ARIA labels for accessibility

**References:**
- [evento documentation](https://docs.rs/evento/1.4.1) - Event sourcing patterns
- [Axum extractors](https://docs.rs/axum/0.8/axum/extract/index.html) - Request handling
- [TwinSpark docs](https://github.com/kasta-ua/twinSpark) - Progressive enhancement

### Action Items

**NONE.** This implementation is production-ready as-is.

**Optional Future Enhancements (Non-blocking):**
- Consider adding email notification option alongside Web Push (out of scope for MVP per tech-spec)
- Could add analytics tracking for completion rates (future product insight)
- Might add snooze option for prep tasks (similar to cooking reminders in Story 4.8)

---

**Review Conclusion:** Story 4.9 represents exemplary software engineering. The implementation is clean, secure, well-tested, and ready for production deployment. **APPROVED** without reservations.
