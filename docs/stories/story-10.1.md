# Story 10.1: End-to-End Testing with Playwright

Status: Approved

## Story

As a QA engineer,
I want to implement a comprehensive E2E test suite using Playwright,
so that all critical user flows for the enhanced meal planning system are validated before production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Playwright test suite configured in `e2e/` directory with TypeScript fixtures for authenticated sessions
   - Verify: `e2e/playwright.config.ts` exists with parallel workers (4), base URL, auth storage path
   - Verify: `e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` provides `authenticatedPage` fixture with JWT cookie

2. **AC2**: Test coverage for multi-week meal plan generation flow
   - Verify: `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts` includes test: "User generates multi-week meal plan (4 weeks)"
   - Verify: Test navigates to `/plan`, submits generation form, asserts success redirect

3. **AC3**: Test coverage for week navigation
   - Verify: Test "User navigates between weeks" clicks "Next Week" button
   - Verify: Calendar updates to show next Monday-Sunday range

4. **AC4**: Test coverage for single week regeneration
   - Verify: Test "User regenerates single week" clicks "Regenerate This Week" button
   - Verify: Meal assignments change for that week only (other weeks unchanged)

5. **AC5**: Test coverage for all future weeks regeneration
   - Verify: Test "User regenerates all future weeks" clicks "Regenerate All Future Weeks" button
   - Verify: All weeks from current week forward are regenerated

   - Verify: `e2e/tests/preferences.spec.ts` navigates to `/profile/meal-planning-preferences`
   - Verify: Test toggles checkboxes (breakfast, lunch, dinner, side dishes), submits form
   - Verify: Preferences saved (next meal plan generation respects preferences)

7. **AC7**: Test coverage for recipe creation with accompaniment settings
   - Verify: `e2e/tests/recipes.spec.ts` navigates to `/recipes/new`
   - Verify: Test fills form with `can_be_side_dish` and `needs_side_dish` checkboxes
   - Verify: Recipe saved with correct accompaniment settings

8. **AC8**: Test coverage for shopping list access for specific week
   - Verify: `e2e/tests/shopping.spec.ts` navigates to `/shopping?week=2025-11-10`
   - Verify: Shopping list displays ingredients for that week only

9. **AC9**: All E2E tests pass in CI pipeline
   - Verify: GitHub Actions workflow executes `npx playwright test` successfully
   - Verify: Exit code 0 (all tests passed)

10. **AC10**: Test execution time <5 minutes

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Testing Architecture** (Test Pyramid Level 3: E2E Tests):
- Playwright provides cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Tests validate full user flows from browser automation perspective
- Complements unit tests (Level 1: domain logic) and integration tests (Level 2: HTTP routes)

**Key Technologies**:
- **Playwright 1.56+**: Browser automation framework with TypeScript support
- **Test Fixtures**: Reusable setup for authenticated sessions, test data seeding
- **Parallel Execution**: 4 workers for <5 minute total execution time
- **Video Recording**: Capture failures only (storage-efficient debugging)

**TwinSpark Testing Considerations**:
- TwinSpark attributes (`ts-req`, `ts-target`, `ts-swap`) enable progressive enhancement
- Tests must wait for DOM updates after TwinSpark AJAX requests
- Use `waitForSelector` instead of fixed delays to avoid flaky tests

**Route Performance Requirements** (validated via E2E):
- Generation: P95 <5s (NFR requirement)
- Navigation: P95 <500ms
- Preferences update: P95 <300ms

### Project Structure Notes

**E2E Test Directory Structure**:
```

├── playwright.config.ts          # Parallel workers, base URL, auth storage
├── fixtures/
│   ├── auth.ts                   # Authenticated session fixture
│   ├── recipes.ts                # Test recipe data (50 recipes)
│   └── meal-plan.ts              # Meal plan test helpers
├── tests/
│   ├── meal-planning.spec.ts     # Multi-week generation, navigation, regeneration

│   └── shopping.spec.ts          # Shopping list access
└── playwright-report/            # HTML report output
```

**CI/CD Integration**:
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Parallel job execution: Unit tests, Integration tests, E2E tests run concurrently
- Artifact uploads: Test reports, videos (7-day retention)

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure**:
- E2E tests isolated from application code (separate `e2e/` directory)
- Test fixtures follow TypeScript module patterns
- CI configuration in `.github/workflows/` per project standards

### Testing Standards Summary

**Playwright Best Practices**:
1. **Test Isolation**: Each test uses isolated authenticated session (no shared state)
2. **Deterministic Assertions**: Use `waitForSelector` instead of `setTimeout` to avoid flaky tests
3. **Parallel Execution**: Tests must pass when run in parallel (4 workers)
4. **Video Recording**: Only for failures (saves storage, aids debugging)
5. **Test Data**: Deterministic fixtures (fixed random seed for reproducibility)

**Reliability Requirements**:
- Flaky test tolerance: 0% (all tests must be deterministic)
- No automatic retries (flaky tests must be fixed, not masked)
- Clean state between tests (database seeded fresh per test)

**CI Requirements**:
- All E2E tests must pass for merge to main
- Test execution time <5 minutes (enforced via timeout)
- Exit code 0 required for deployment gate

### Completion Notes List

**Story 10.1 Implementation Complete**

1. **Playwright Infrastructure (AC1)**:
   - Updated `e2e/playwright.config.ts` with 4 parallel workers for <5min execution
   - Configured auth storage path at `./fixtures/.auth/user.json`
   - Created `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts` for authentication setup (runs once before all tests)
   - Created `e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` with `authenticatedPage` fixture for reusable authenticated sessions
   - Created `e2e/fixtures/recipes.ts` with 50 deterministic test recipes covering diverse cuisines, complexities, and prep requirements

2. **Meal Planning E2E Tests (AC2-5)**:
   - Created `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts` with comprehensive test coverage
   - Test: "User generates multi-week meal plan (4 weeks)" - validates form submission, redirect to /plan?week={monday}, and calendar display
   - Test: "User navigates between weeks" - verifies Next/Previous buttons update calendar to correct Monday-Sunday range (7-day increments)
   - Test: "User regenerates single week" - confirms only target week changes, other weeks remain unchanged
   - Test: "User regenerates all future weeks" - validates all weeks from current forward are regenerated
   - Used `waitForSelector` for deterministic assertions (no fixed delays per Story Context constraint)

3. **Preferences E2E Tests (AC6)**:
   - Created `e2e/tests/preferences.spec.ts` with 3 comprehensive tests
   - Test: Basic preferences update - toggles breakfast/lunch/dinner/side dishes checkboxes, verifies persistence
   - Test: Preferences applied to meal plan generation - confirms disabled meal types are excluded from generated plans
   - Test: Form validation - verifies at least one meal type must remain selected

4. **Recipe E2E Tests (AC7)**:
   - Updated existing `e2e/tests/recipe.spec.ts` with new test suite for accompaniment settings
   - Test: Recipe creation with `can_be_side_dish` - verifies checkbox visible, checked state persists
   - Test: Recipe creation with `needs_side_dish` - validates setting persists through edit form
   - Test: Both accompaniment settings checked - edge case coverage
   - Test: Default state verification - confirms checkboxes default to unchecked

5. **Shopping List E2E Tests (AC8)**:
   - Created `e2e/tests/shopping.spec.ts` with 6 comprehensive tests
   - Test: Week-specific shopping list access via `/shopping?week=YYYY-MM-DD` query parameter
   - Test: Week selector navigation between weeks
   - Test: Empty state handling for weeks with no meal plan
   - Test: Category grouping verification (Produce, Dairy, Meat, etc.)
   - Test: Checkoff functionality with visual feedback
   - Test: Shopping list updates when meal plan regenerated (integration test)

6. **CI Integration (AC9-10)**:
   - Created `.github/workflows/test.yml` with 3 parallel jobs: unit/integration tests, E2E tests, code coverage
   - E2E job configured with 4 Playwright workers (matching local config)
   - Video recording enabled for failures only (`video: 'retain-on-failure'` in playwright.config.ts)
   - Artifact uploads configured: playwright-report (always), playwright-videos (on failure), 7-day retention
   - Job timeout set to 15 minutes (AC10 requires <5min for E2E tests, enforced via `timeout-minutes: 5` on test step)
   - Application server startup with health check before tests run

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Used Playwright's project dependencies feature (setup project runs authentication once, all browser projects depend on it)
- Leveraged storageState for session persistence (avoids manual login in each test, improves speed)
- TwinSpark-aware test design: used `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` and `waitForSelector` after AJAX requests
- Test isolation: each test uses authenticated session but tests run in parallel without cross-contamination

**Testing Notes**:
- Tests use flexible selectors (data-testid, class names, text content) to accommodate implementation variations
- All tests follow "Arrange-Act-Assert" pattern with clear verification steps
- Edge cases covered: empty states, validation failures, week boundaries, regeneration scenarios

**Review Action Items Resolution** (2025-10-27):

All 8 action items from Senior Developer Review resolved:

**Medium Severity (4 items)**:
1. ✅ Test credentials extracted to environment variables (`TEST_USER_EMAIL`, `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`) with fallback defaults
2. ✅ Health endpoint verified - already implemented at `src/routes/health.rs:28` with unit tests
3. ✅ StorageState configuration moved from global `use` block to individual browser projects (setup project no longer loads non-existent auth file)
4. ✅ Test database seeding strategy documented in `e2e/README.md` and implemented in CI workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml:87-102`) with argon2id hash for test user

**Low Severity (4 items)**:
5. ✅ .auth directory creation added to `auth.setup.ts` using `mkdir(dirname(authFile), { recursive: true })` to prevent ENOENT errors
6. ✅ .gitignore entries added: `e2e/fixtures/.auth/*.json` (prevents JWT token commits)
7. ✅ CI coverage check replaced `bc -l` with awk for portability (`awk '{print ($1 < 80)}'`)
8. ✅ Individual test timeout added to Playwright config: `timeout: 60000` (60 seconds per test)

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve test reliability, security, and CI portability.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer**: Jonathan
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Outcome**: **Changes Requested**

### Summary

Story 10.1 successfully implements a comprehensive Playwright E2E test suite covering all 10 acceptance criteria. The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to testing best practices: 4 parallel workers for performance, authentication fixtures for test isolation, deterministic test data (50 recipes), TwinSpark-aware selectors with `waitForSelector`, and CI integration with video recording on failures only.

All critical user flows are covered: multi-week generation, week navigation, single/bulk regeneration, preferences updates, recipe accompaniment settings, and shopping list access. The test suite architecture uses Playwright's project dependencies pattern effectively (setup runs once, all browsers reuse authenticated session).

**However**, there are several medium-severity issues that should be addressed before production deployment, primarily around test environment configuration, secret management, and database seeding strategy.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity
None identified.

#### Medium Severity

**[Med-1] Hardcoded Test Credentials in Authentication Fixture**
**File**: `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts:22-23`
**Issue**: Test credentials (`test@example.com` / `password123`) are hardcoded in the setup file, posing security risks if credentials are shared with production-like environments.
**Impact**: Credentials may be inadvertently used in staging/production databases, creating security vulnerabilities.
**Recommendation**: Extract credentials to environment variables (`TEST_USER_EMAIL`, `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`) and load via `process.env` in auth.setup.ts. Document required env vars in README/CI docs.
**AC Impact**: None (implementation complete), but affects operational security.

**[Med-2] Missing Health Check Endpoint Validation**
**File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml:92`
**Issue**: CI workflow assumes `/health` endpoint exists (`curl -f http://localhost:3000/health`) but this endpoint is not verified to exist in the codebase.
**Impact**: CI job may fail with cryptic timeout errors if health endpoint is missing or returns non-2xx status.
**Recommendation**: Verify `/health` route exists in Axum router (`src/routes/health.rs` or similar). If missing, implement basic health check route returning 200 OK. Alternative: use root `/` endpoint if it returns 200.
**AC Impact**: AC9 (tests pass in CI) - may cause false failures.

**[Med-3] Setup Project Loads Unnecessary Storage State**
**File**: `e2e/playwright.config.ts:23`
**Issue**: The `setup` project (which creates the auth session) is configured to load `storageState: './fixtures/.auth/user.json'` globally via `use` block, but setup should run *before* this file exists.
**Impact**: May cause initialization failures if Playwright strictly validates storageState path existence. Currently non-blocking because setup runs before other projects, but fragile.
**Recommendation**: Move `storageState` config into each browser project explicitly (chromium, firefox, etc.) instead of global `use` block. Keep setup project without storageState.
**AC Impact**: AC1 (auth fixtures) - configuration correctness.

**[Med-4] Test Data Seeding Strategy Unclear**
**File**: `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts`, test specs
**Issue**: Tests assume `test@example.com` user exists in database with correct password, and that database has necessary schema. No documented seeding strategy or migration verification step in CI.
**Impact**: Tests will fail in fresh CI environments if test user doesn't exist or database schema is outdated.
**Recommendation**: Add database seeding step to CI workflow *before* starting application server: create test user with known credentials, seed with test recipes if needed. Document seeding requirements in `e2e/README.md`.
**AC Impact**: AC9 (tests pass in CI) - reliability issue.

#### Low Severity

**[Low-1] Missing .auth Directory Creation**
**File**: `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts:8`
**Issue**: Auth setup assumes `.auth` directory exists under `fixtures/`. If directory is missing, setup fails with ENOENT error.
**Impact**: First-time test runners may encounter confusing errors.
**Recommendation**: Add directory creation in auth.setup.ts before saving storageState: `await fs.mkdir(dirname(authFile), { recursive: true })` (import `fs/promises`).

**[Low-2] Missing .gitignore Entry for Auth Secrets**
**File**: `.gitignore`
**Issue**: `e2e/fixtures/.auth/*.json` files contain session tokens (JWT) which should not be committed to version control.
**Impact**: Risk of exposing session tokens if developers accidentally commit auth files.
**Recommendation**: Add to `.gitignore`: `e2e/fixtures/.auth/*.json`

**[Low-3] Shell Arithmetic Portability in CI Coverage Check**
**File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml:171`
**Issue**: Coverage threshold check uses `bc -l` for floating-point comparison, which may not be installed in all CI environments.
**Impact**: Coverage job may fail with "bc: command not found".
**Recommendation**: Use shell arithmetic instead: `if [ $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | awk '{print ($1 < 80)}') -eq 1 ]; then ...`  or install bc explicitly: `apt-get install -y bc` in workflow.

**[Low-4] Missing Individual Test Timeout**
**File**: `e2e/playwright.config.ts`
**Issue**: No `timeout` configured for individual tests. Default Playwright timeout is 30 seconds per test, which may be too generous for fast unit-style E2E tests.
**Impact**: Slow/hung tests may delay CI feedback unnecessarily.
**Recommendation**: Add `timeout: 60000` (60s) to config `use` block to catch hung tests faster while allowing reasonable execution time.

**[Low-5] Missing Test Artifacts Cleanup Strategy**
**File**: CI workflow, `.gitignore`
**Issue**: Test artifacts (`e2e/test-results/`, `e2e/playwright-report/`) accumulate locally and should be ignored in git. CI already handles artifact uploads.
**Impact**: Developers may accidentally commit large video files or reports.
**Recommendation**: Add to `.gitignore`: `e2e/test-results/`, `e2e/playwright-report/`

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC  | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|-----|--------|----------|-------|
| AC1 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/playwright.config.ts:13` (4 workers), `e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` (fixture), `e2e/fixtures/recipes.ts` (50 recipes) | Full compliance. Minor config issue (Med-3) doesn't block functionality. |
| AC2 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts:22-65` (multi-week generation test) | Test validates form submission, redirect, calendar display. |
| AC3 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts:72-113` (week navigation test) | Verifies Next/Previous buttons, URL updates, 7-day advancement. |
| AC4 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts:120-166` (single week regeneration test) | Confirms only target week changes, other weeks unchanged. |
| AC5 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts:173-222` (all future weeks regeneration test) | Validates all future weeks regenerated from current forward. |
| AC6 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/tests/preferences.spec.ts:22-70` (preferences update), lines 77-145 (application verification) | 3 comprehensive tests including form validation. |
| AC7 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/tests/recipe.spec.ts:565-718` (accompaniment settings tests) | 4 tests covering can_be_side_dish, needs_side_dish, both, defaults. |
| AC8 | ✅ Pass | `e2e/tests/shopping.spec.ts:18-65` (week-specific access), 6 total tests | Covers week parameter, empty states, category grouping, checkoff. |
| AC9 | ⚠️ Conditional | `.github/workflows/test.yml:40-126` (E2E job) | Implementation complete, but **Med-2** (health check) and **Med-4** (seeding) may cause CI failures. |
| AC10 | ✅ Pass | `.github/workflows/test.yml:102` (`timeout-minutes: 5`), `playwright.config.ts:13` (4 workers) | Enforced via CI timeout. Actual execution time to be validated post-deployment. |

**Overall AC Coverage**: 9/10 fully passed, 1 conditional on resolving CI environment issues (Med-2, Med-4).

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Strengths**:
- 20+ E2E tests across 4 new spec files + 1 updated file
- Happy path coverage: 100% for all critical flows
- Edge case coverage: Empty states, validation failures, week boundaries
- Test isolation: Proper use of authenticated fixtures, no cross-test contamination
- Deterministic assertions: `waitForSelector` used consistently per TwinSpark constraint
- Cross-browser testing: 6 browser projects (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, 3 mobile devices)

**Gaps** (Non-blocking for MVP):
- **Error scenario testing**: No tests for network failures mid-flow, server 500 errors, or auth token expiration during test execution
- **Performance testing**: E2E tests don't validate P95 latency requirements (<5s generation, <500ms routes) - deferred to Story 10.2
- **Accessibility testing**: No axe-core integration or screen reader validation - per Epic 10 scope, manual testing sufficient for MVP
- **Concurrent user simulation**: Tests run in parallel workers but don't simulate concurrent multi-user scenarios - covered by Story 10.2 load testing

**Recommendation**: Current gaps are acceptable for MVP given explicit Epic 10 scope boundaries. Consider adding error scenario tests in Story 10.3 (Bug Fixing) if issues arise during manual QA.

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Compliant** with event-sourced monolith architecture and Epic 10 Tech Spec:

- **Test Pyramid Level 3**: E2E tests correctly positioned at top of pyramid (complements unit/integration tests per Tech Spec lines 119-128)
- **TwinSpark Progressive Enhancement**: Tests use `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` and `waitForSelector` after AJAX requests (AC constraint: avoid fixed delays)
- **Playwright Project Dependencies**: Setup project runs authentication once, all browser projects reuse session via `storageState` (efficient pattern per Playwright docs)
- **Parallel Execution**: 4 workers configured (matches Story Context constraint for <5min execution)
- **Test Fixtures**: 50 deterministic recipes with fixed random seed (reproducibility constraint met)
- **CI Integration**: 3-job workflow (unit, E2E, coverage) aligns with Tech Spec "Workflow 1: E2E Test Execution Flow" (lines 381-427)

**Architectural Decisions**:
- **Authentication Strategy**: Using Playwright `storageState` API for JWT cookie persistence is industry-standard approach, superior to manual login in each test
- **Test Data Management**: 50-recipe fixture in TypeScript (not database-seeded) is appropriate for E2E tests - avoids database coupling, enables test portability
- **Video Recording**: `retain-on-failure` strategy balances debugging needs with storage costs (AC9 requirement)

### Security Notes

**🔒 No Critical Security Issues Identified**

**Medium Security Concerns**:
- **[Med-1] Hardcoded Credentials**: (Covered above) Test credentials should be environment variables
- **[Low-2] Missing .gitignore**: (Covered above) JWT session files should not be committed

**Positive Security Practices**:
- Tests use authentication (no bypassing auth for convenience)
- No secrets or API keys exposed in test files (beyond test credentials issue)
- CI workflow doesn't expose sensitive environment variables in logs
- Test videos uploaded only on failure (limits exposure of application state)

**Recommendation**: Address Med-1 before merging to main. Consider secret scanning tool (e.g., git-secrets, trufflehog) in CI to catch accidental credential commits.

### Best-Practices and References

**Playwright Best Practices (v1.56)** - Official Docs: https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices

✅ **Followed**:
- Use `test fixtures` for reusable setup (auth.ts fixture implementation)
- Avoid fixed delays with `waitForSelector` (TwinSpark-aware)
- Parallelize tests for speed (4 workers)
- Record video only on failures (storage optimization)
- Use descriptive test names (`test('User generates multi-week meal plan (4 weeks)', ...)`)

⚠️ **Partially Followed**:
- "Use test data isolation": Tests use shared auth session (acceptable tradeoff for speed), but should ensure test recipes don't conflict if run concurrently against real database
- "Configure timeout per test": Missing individual test timeout (Low-4)

**TypeScript/Node.js Best Practices**:
- ✅ ESM imports used (`import { fileURLToPath }` in auth.setup.ts)
- ✅ TypeScript enabled for type safety
- ⚠️ Missing TypeScript strict mode in `e2e/tsconfig.json` (not reviewed, but recommended)

**GitHub Actions CI/CD Best Practices** - Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides

✅ **Followed**:
- Cache Cargo dependencies for faster builds (`actions/cache@v4`)
- Use timeout-minutes to prevent hung jobs (15min job, 5min test step)
- Upload artifacts only when needed (`if: always()` for reports, `if: failure()` for videos)
- Pin action versions (`@v4` instead of `@latest`)

⚠️ **Improvement Opportunities**:
- Use `secrets.` context for sensitive env vars instead of hardcoded DATABASE_URL
- Add job concurrency limits to prevent overlapping CI runs on rapid commits
- Consider reusable workflow for test jobs (DRY principle)

### Action Items

**Must Fix Before Merge (Medium Severity)**:

1. **[Action-1][Med]** Extract test credentials to environment variables
   **File**: `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts:22-23`
   **Change**: Replace hardcoded credentials with `process.env.TEST_USER_EMAIL || 'test@example.com'` and `process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD || 'password123'`. Document in `e2e/README.md`.
   **Owner**: Dev Team
   **AC**: AC1, AC9

2. **[Action-2][Med]** Verify /health endpoint exists or implement it
   **File**: Axum router configuration (src/routes/)

3. **[Action-3][Med]** Move storageState config out of global use block
   **File**: `e2e/playwright.config.ts:16-24`
   **Change**: Remove `storageState` from global `use` block. Add `use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], storageState: './fixtures/.auth/user.json' }` to each browser project explicitly (chromium, firefox, webkit, mobile). Leave setup project without storageState.
   **Owner**: QA/Dev Team
   **AC**: AC1

4. **[Action-4][Med]** Document and implement test database seeding strategy
   **File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` (new step before "Start application server"), `e2e/README.md` (new file)
   **Change**: Add CI step: "Seed test database" that runs a script (e.g., `cargo run --bin seed-test-db`) to create test user with known credentials. Document seeding requirements in `e2e/README.md` for local development.
   **Owner**: Backend Dev, QA
   **AC**: AC9

**Recommended Improvements (Low Severity)**:

5. **[Action-5][Low]** Add .auth directory creation in auth.setup.ts
   **File**: `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts:8`
   **Change**: `import { mkdir } from 'fs/promises'; await mkdir(dirname(authFile), { recursive: true });` before `page.context().storageState()`.
   **Owner**: QA/Dev Team

6. **[Action-6][Low]** Add .gitignore entries for E2E artifacts
   **File**: `.gitignore`
   **Change**: Append lines: `e2e/fixtures/.auth/*.json`, `e2e/test-results/`, `e2e/playwright-report/`
   **Owner**: Dev Team

7. **[Action-7][Low]** Replace bc with shell arithmetic in CI coverage check
   **File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml:171`
   **Change**: Replace `bc -l` with awk: `if [ $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | awk '{print ($1 < 80)}') -eq 1 ]; then`
   **Owner**: DevOps

8. **[Action-8][Low]** Add individual test timeout to Playwright config
   **File**: `e2e/playwright.config.ts:16`
   **Change**: Add to `use` block: `timeout: 60000, // 60 seconds per test`
   **Owner**: QA/Dev Team

## Final Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer**: Jonathan
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Outcome**: **APPROVED FOR MERGE** ✅

### Summary

Story 10.1 has successfully addressed all 8 action items from the initial review. The implementation now meets production-ready standards with proper security practices, CI reliability improvements, and comprehensive documentation.

### Action Items Resolution Verification

**Medium Severity Items (4/4 resolved)**:

1. ✅ **Test Credentials Extracted to Environment Variables**
   - **Verified**: `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts:27-28` uses `process.env.TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD` with secure fallback defaults
   - **Documented**: `e2e/README.md:14-17` documents required environment variables
   - **Quality**: Excellent implementation with clear documentation

2. ✅ **Health Endpoint Verified**
   - **Verified**: `src/routes/health.rs:28-30` implements health endpoint returning 200 OK with `{"status": "ok"}`
   - **Tested**: Unit test at `src/routes/health.rs:60-63` confirms endpoint behavior
   - **CI Integration**: `.github/workflows/test.yml:109` successfully uses endpoint for server readiness check
   - **Quality**: Production-ready with test coverage

3. ✅ **StorageState Configuration Corrected**
   - **Verified**: Global `use` block in `e2e/playwright.config.ts:16-24` no longer contains `storageState`
   - **Verified**: Each browser project (chromium, firefox, webkit, mobile devices) explicitly configures `storageState: './fixtures/.auth/user.json'` at lines 39, 47, 55, 65, 73, 83
   - **Verified**: Setup project (lines 28-31) correctly omits `storageState` since it creates the file
   - **Quality**: Proper Playwright pattern implementation, eliminates initialization race condition

4. ✅ **Test Database Seeding Strategy Implemented**
   - **CI Implementation**: `.github/workflows/test.yml:87-102` includes comprehensive seeding step with argon2id password hash
   - **Documentation**: `e2e/README.md:23-50` provides detailed setup instructions for local development and CI environments
   - **Security**: Uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` to prevent duplicate key errors, proper argon2id hash for test password
   - **Quality**: Production-grade implementation with clear documentation

**Low Severity Items (4/4 resolved)**:

5. ✅ **.auth Directory Creation Added**
   - **Verified**: `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts:41` calls `await mkdir(dirname(authFile), { recursive: true })`
   - **Import**: Line 4 correctly imports `mkdir` from 'fs/promises'
   - **Quality**: Prevents ENOENT errors, proper async/await usage

6. ✅ **.gitignore Entries Added**
   - **Verified**: `.gitignore:33` contains `e2e/fixtures/.auth/*.json` (prevents JWT token commits)
   - **Verified**: `.gitignore:31-32` contains `e2e/playwright-report/` and `e2e/test-results/`
   - **Quality**: Comprehensive coverage of all E2E artifacts

7. ✅ **bc Replaced with awk for Portability**
   - **Verified**: `.github/workflows/test.yml:189` uses `awk '{print ($1 < 80)}'` for floating-point comparison
   - **Comment Added**: Line 188 explains the change rationale ("more portable than bc")
   - **Quality**: Eliminates dependency on bc, improves CI portability

8. ✅ **Individual Test Timeout Added**
   - **Verified**: `e2e/playwright.config.ts:23` sets `timeout: 60000` (60 seconds)
   - **Comment Added**: Line 22 explains purpose ("catch hung tests while allowing reasonable execution time")
   - **Quality**: Reasonable timeout value with clear documentation
