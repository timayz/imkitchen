# Story 5.2: Service Worker for Offline Support

Status: Done

## Story

As a **user**,
I want **app to work offline**,
so that **I can access recipes in kitchen without internet**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Service worker registered on first app visit
2. Service worker caches critical assets: HTML, CSS, JS, fonts, images
3. Recipe pages cached after first view
4. Offline-first strategy: serve from cache, fallback to network
5. Network-first for HTML requests with cache fallback
6. Graceful offline indicator when network unavailable
7. Background sync queues actions taken offline (favorite recipe, mark prep complete) for later sync
8. Cache versioning ensures updates deployed without breaking offline experience

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

- **Service Worker Lifecycle**: Registration → Installation → Activation → Fetch interception
- **Workbox Framework**: Industry-standard toolkit for PWA caching strategies, precaching manifest generation
- **Caching Strategies**:
  - **Network-First**: HTML pages (fresh content prioritized, fallback to cache offline)
  - **Cache-First**: Images, static assets (fast offline access, update in background)
  - **Stale-While-Revalidate**: API data (serve cache immediately, update in background)
- **Background Sync API**: Queues failed mutations when offline, replays on reconnect with exponential backoff
- **Cache Versioning**: `cacheId` prefix ensures old caches deleted on service worker update

```

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Service worker logic (precaching, caching strategies, sync queue)
- **Integration Tests**: Service worker lifecycle (install, activate, fetch), cache operations
- **E2E Tests**: Full offline scenarios (load cached pages, background sync, update flow) with Playwright
- **Cross-Browser**: iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+, desktop Chrome/Firefox
- **Performance**: Service worker registration <100ms, cache lookup <50ms
- **Coverage Target**: 80% via workbox-testing + integration tests

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Solution Architecture:**
- Service worker served via Axum static route or existing RustEmbed Assets service (src/routes/assets.rs)
- Workbox 7.1+ generates sw.js from sw-source.js config (build step)
- Askama base template (templates/base.html) includes sw-register.js script
- Offline fallback page follows Tailwind CSS design system
- Background Sync queues evento domain events (RecipeFavorited, PrepTaskCompleted) for replay

**No Conflicts Detected** - New JavaScript files, new offline template, Workbox build integration via npm scripts

4. **Offline Fallback (AC 6):**
   - Created standalone offline.html template with Tailwind CSS
   - Added /offline route handler in health.rs
   - Service worker serves offline page when navigation fails
   - Includes helpful messaging and connection status monitoring

5. **Background Sync (AC 7):**
   - Implemented IndexedDB queue for offline mutations
   - Sync event listener replays queued requests

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Jonathan
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Outcome:** **Approve**

### Summary

Story 5.2 delivers comprehensive service worker offline support with exceptional implementation quality. All 8 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with production-ready code that demonstrates strong architectural awareness, thorough testing (8/8 integration tests passing), and careful preservation of existing functionality (Story 4.6 push notifications). The implementation properly leverages Workbox 7.1.0, implements sophisticated caching strategies, provides graceful offline fallback, and includes background sync capabilities for offline mutations. Code quality is excellent with proper error handling, resource cleanup, and adherence to JavaScript best practices.

### Key Findings

**Strengths (High Impact):**

1. **Excellent Workbox Integration** - Proper use of `injectManifest` mode preserves existing push notification handlers from Story 4.6 while adding comprehensive caching. Clean separation of concerns between Workbox caching logic and custom service worker event handlers.

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - 8 integration tests all passing, covering offline route, service worker serving, script validation, authentication requirements, and helpful content. E2E test suite in Playwright covers all 8 ACs with cross-browser scenarios. Test quality is high with meaningful assertions.

3. **Proper Resource Management** - Service worker correctly uses `event.waitUntil()` for all async operations (precaching, sync, notifications). IndexedDB operations properly handle transactions and cleanup. No resource leaks detected.

4. **Strong Error Handling** - Service worker registration has proper try-catch with console logging. Background sync implements exponential backoff (max 3 retries) with proper error propagation. Offline page handles connection status monitoring gracefully.

5. **Security Best Practices** - Service worker scope properly restricted to root `/`. No inline scripts (CSP-compliant). Workbox CDN loaded via `importScripts` (standard pattern). No sensitive data in service worker or cache keys.

**Minor Issues (Low Severity):**

1. **SW Update Polling Interval** (`sw-register.js:46`) - 60-second update check interval may be aggressive for production. Consider increasing to 5-10 minutes or using navigation-triggered updates only.
   - *File:* `static/js/sw-register.js:46`
   - *Suggested Fix:* Change to `300000` (5 minutes) or remove setInterval entirely and rely on browser's default update checks

2. **Hardcoded Workbox CDN Version** (`sw-source.js:5`) - Workbox loaded from CDN with hardcoded version `7.1.0`. Consider using a CDN with auto-minor-version updates (e.g., `7.1/workbox-sw.js`) or local bundled Workbox for offline-first guarantee.
   - *File:* `static/js/sw-source.js:5`
   - *Suggested Fix:* Document CDN dependency in deployment checklist or migrate to npm-installed Workbox modules

3. **Missing Cache Size Limits** (`sw-source.js`) - While expiration policies set maxEntries, consider adding storage quota monitoring to prevent unbounded cache growth on devices with limited storage.
   - *File:* `static/js/sw-source.js`
   - *Suggested Enhancement:* Add storage quota checks in install handler, log warnings when approaching limits

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC 1: Service worker registered on first app visit | ✅ **Met** | `sw-register.js` with feature detection, DOMContentLoaded registration, root scope |
| AC 2: Service worker caches critical assets | ✅ **Met** | Workbox precaches 26 assets (528 kB), includes HTML, CSS, JS, fonts, images |
| AC 3: Recipe pages cached after first view | ✅ **Met** | Network-first strategy with 7-day cache retention for navigate requests |
| AC 4: Offline-first strategy | ✅ **Met** | Cache-first for images (30-day), static assets (1-year), network-first with cache fallback |
| AC 5: Network-first for HTML requests | ✅ **Met** | Navigate requests use NetworkFirst with 3s timeout, cache fallback |
| AC 6: Graceful offline indicator | ✅ **Met** | `offline-indicator.js` displays gray banner offline, green "back online" banner (auto-dismiss 3s) |
| AC 7: Background sync queues offline actions | ✅ **Met** | IndexedDB queue, sync event listener, exponential backoff (max 3 retries), comprehensive queue management functions |
| AC 8: Cache versioning ensures updates | ✅ **Met** | CacheId `imkitchen-v1`, skipWaiting + clientsClaim, update detection with refresh notification |

**Coverage Assessment:** 100% (8/8 ACs fully satisfied)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Integration Tests** (`tests/service_worker_tests.rs`): **8/8 passing** ✅
- ✅ Offline route returns 200 OK
- ✅ Offline route content type is text/html
- ✅ Service worker served from /static/sw.js with correct MIME type
- ✅ sw-register.js contains registration logic
- ✅ offline-indicator.js contains online/offline event listeners
- ✅ Non-existent static files return 404
- ✅ Offline page accessible without authentication
- ✅ Offline page contains helpful messaging

**E2E Tests** (`e2e/tests/service-worker-offline.spec.ts`): Comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Service worker registration and scope validation
- ✅ Critical asset caching verification
- ✅ Recipe page caching after first view
- ✅ Offline fallback page display
- ✅ Offline indicator UI behavior
- ✅ Background sync queueing and replay
- ✅ Cache versioning and update flow
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox)

**Test Quality:** High - Proper use of `unsafe_oneshot` for synchronous event processing (per your testing standards), meaningful assertions, good edge case coverage.

**Gaps:** None critical. Consider adding:
- Performance tests for cache lookup latency (<50ms target per tech spec)
- Storage quota boundary tests (what happens at 90% quota)
- Network flakiness scenarios (intermittent connectivity)

### Architectural Alignment

**Excellent Alignment with Solution Architecture:**

1. ✅ **Offline-First Progressive Enhancement** - Service worker intercepts requests, serves cached content offline, degrades gracefully
2. ✅ **Server-Rendered Foundation** - Offline page is standalone HTML (not Askama template dependency), works without backend
3. ✅ **Workbox 7.1+ Requirement** - Tech spec mandates Workbox 7.1+, implementation uses 7.1.0 from CDN
4. ✅ **Caching Strategy Alignment** - Network-first for HTML, cache-first for images/static, matches tech spec §8.3
5. ✅ **Background Sync API** - Queues offline mutations per architecture, replays on reconnect
6. ✅ **RustEmbed Assets Service** - Service worker served via existing Assets service (no custom route needed), proper MIME type detection

**Layering Compliance:**
- Service worker layer properly separated from application logic
- No tight coupling between SW and backend evento/CQRS patterns
- Offline fallback gracefully handles missing user context

**No Architecture Violations Detected**

### Security Notes

**Security Review:** No high-severity issues found

**Secure Patterns:**
- ✅ Service worker scope restricted to root `/` (prevents scope escalation)
- ✅ No inline scripts (CSP-compliant)
- ✅ Workbox loaded via `importScripts` from HTTPS CDN (integrity not validated but standard pattern)
- ✅ IndexedDB operations use proper transactions (no race conditions)
- ✅ No sensitive data cached (recipes are public/user-owned content)
- ✅ Background sync requests preserve original headers (authentication maintained)

**Low-Severity Observations:**
1. **Workbox CDN SRI** - Consider adding Subresource Integrity (SRI) hash to `importScripts` for CDN integrity verification
   - *Impact:* Low (Google CDN is trusted, but SRI adds defense-in-depth)
   - *Recommendation:* Add SRI hash or migrate to npm-bundled Workbox

2. **Cache Poisoning Risk** - CacheableResponsePlugin allows status 0 (opaque responses). Ensure CORS is properly configured for cross-origin resources.
   - *Impact:* Low (mostly serving same-origin content)
   - *Current State:* Acceptable for MVP

### Best-Practices and References

**Framework Alignment:**
- ✅ **Workbox 7.1.0** - Latest stable version, follows [Workbox Documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching)
- ✅ **Service Worker Lifecycle** - Proper install/activate/fetch handlers per [MDN Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
- ✅ **Background Sync API** - Correct implementation per [MDN Background Sync](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API)
- ✅ **JavaScript Best Practices** - IIFE encapsulation, strict mode, async/await, proper error handling

**Deviations from Standards:** None

**Notable Patterns:**
- **injectManifest over generateSW** - Correct choice to preserve Story 4.6 push handlers
- **IndexedDB for Sync Queue** - Standard browser API, no external library dependency (good for offline-first)
- **Offline Page as Standalone HTML** - Avoids Askama template/user field dependency, works in all offline scenarios
