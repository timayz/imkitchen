# Story 8.1: Create Multi-Week Generation Route

Status: Done

## Story

As a backend developer,
I want to create a POST route that generates multi-week meal plans,
so that authenticated users can trigger intelligent meal plan generation via HTTP API.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Route `POST /plan/generate-multi-week` created
2. Route protected by authentication middleware (JWT cookie)
3. Handler extracts `user_id` from JWT claims
4. Handler loads user's favorite recipes from database (read model query)
5. Handler loads user's meal planning preferences from users table
6. Handler calls `generate_multi_week_meal_plans` algorithm (Epic 7)
7. Handler commits `MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated` event to evento
8. Handler returns JSON with first week data + navigation links
9. Error: `InsufficientRecipes` returns 400 with helpful message + "Add Recipe" action
10. Error: `AlgorithmTimeout` returns 500 with retry message
11. Integration test: POST generates meal plan, verifies JSON response structure

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Sourced CQRS**: Route handler emits evento events, projections update read models asynchronously
- **TDD Enforced**: Write failing integration test first, implement route handler to pass, refactor
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1+**: Not applicable to backend route (Epic 9 responsibility for frontend rendering)
- **Test Pattern**: Use `unsafe_oneshot` for evento subscriptions in tests to process events synchronously

### Source Tree Components
- **Route Handler**: `crates/api/src/routes/meal_planning.rs` - Create new file if doesn't exist
- **Error Types**: `crates/api/src/errors.rs` - Define `ApiError` enum and `IntoResponse` implementation
- **Domain Algorithm**: `crates/meal_planning/src/algorithm.rs` - Epic 7 implementation (already exists)
- **Integration Tests**: `crates/api/tests/integration/test_meal_planning_routes.rs`
- **Router Configuration**: `crates/api/src/main.rs` or `crates/api/src/router.rs`

### Testing Standards
- **Coverage Target**: >85% line coverage for route handler code (measured via cargo-tarpaulin)
- **Integration Tests**: Full HTTP request/response cycle with database and evento
- **Performance Target**: Route overhead <500ms P95 (excluding algorithm execution time)
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in transaction, rolled back after completion

### Key Technical Constraints
- **Authentication**: JWT cookie-based (Epic 1 implementation), middleware extracts `user_id` from claims
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLx for parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
- **Evento Events**: Use `unsafe_oneshot` in tests for synchronous projection processing (not `run`)
- **Response Format**: JSON by default, Epic 9 handles HTML rendering via Askama templates

### Algorithm Integration
- **Function Call**: `generate_multi_week_meal_plans(user_id, recipes, preferences).await`
- **Input Validation**: Algorithm expects at least 7 favorite recipes per category (appetizers, main_courses, desserts)
- **Performance**: Algorithm execution <5s for 50 recipes (Epic 7 benchmark)
- **Error Handling**: Algorithm returns `Result<MultiWeekMealPlan, Error>` with typed error variants

### Evento Event Schema
```rust
MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated {
    generation_batch_id: String,  // UUID
    user_id: String,               // UUID from JWT
    weeks: Vec<WeekMealPlanData>,  // 3-5 weeks of meal assignments
    rotation_state: RotationState, // Tracks which recipes were used
    generated_at: DateTime<Utc>,   // Timestamp
}
```

### Project Structure Notes
- Aligns with event-driven monolith architecture
- Follows established pattern: Route → Domain Logic → Evento Event → Projection
- Database connection pooling configured (min 5, max 20 connections)
- Rate limiting: 5 meal plan generations per user per hour (Epic 8 NFR)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

### Reviewer
Jonathan

### Date
2025-10-26

### Outcome
**Changes Requested**

### Summary
Story 8.1 successfully implements the POST /plan/generate-multi-week route with proper authentication, error handling, and evento integration. The implementation correctly integrates with the Epic 7 multi-week generation algorithm, emits evento events, and returns well-structured JSON responses. Code quality is solid with comprehensive logging and appropriate error handling. However, **integration tests (AC-11) are missing**, which is a critical gap for this backend API story.

### Key Findings

**High Severity:**
1. **Missing Integration Tests (AC-11)**: No tests verify the end-to-end flow, evento event emission, or read model projections. This is explicitly required by AC-11 and the TDD approach enforced in Dev Notes.
   - **File**: `tests/` directory
   - **Impact**: Cannot verify the route works correctly with JWT auth, database queries, algorithm integration, or evento event handling
   - **Action**: Create `tests/multi_week_api_integration_tests.rs` with test scenarios per AC-11 requirements

**Medium Severity:**
2. **Hardcoded Cuisine Default**: `load_favorite_recipes` defaults all recipes to `Cuisine::Italian` (line 351), ignoring the `cuisine` field from RecipeReadModel
   - **File**: `src/routes/meal_planning_api.rs:351`
   - **Impact**: Algorithm's cuisine variety scoring may not work as intended
   - **Action**: Parse cuisine from `r.cuisine` Option<String> field or dietary tags

3. **Accompaniment Category Simplification**: `build_multi_week_response` returns hardcoded "other" for all accompaniment categories (line 493)
   - **File**: `src/routes/meal_planning_api.rs:493`
   - **Impact**: Frontend loses accompaniment category information
   - **Action**: Implement proper AccompanimentCategory to string conversion

4. **Unused Database Pool Parameter**: `build_multi_week_response` accepts `db_pool: &SqlitePool` but never uses it (line 456)
   - **File**: `src/routes/meal_planning_api.rs:456`
   - **Impact**: Code smell, confusing API surface
   - **Action**: Remove unused parameter or document why it's reserved for future use

**Low Severity:**
5. **No Rate Limiting**: Story references "5 meal plan generations per user per hour" (Dev Notes line 148), but no rate limiting middleware is implemented
   - **Impact**: Users could spam the expensive algorithm endpoint
   - **Action**: Add rate limiting middleware or create follow-up story

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC-1 | ✅ | Route registered in `main.rs:287-290` |
| AC-2 | ✅ | Protected by auth middleware via route_layer |
| AC-3 | ✅ | Extracts user_id via `Extension(Auth)` |
| AC-4 | ✅ | `load_favorite_recipes()` queries via `query_recipes_by_user` |
| AC-5 | ✅ | `load_user_preferences()` loads from users table |
| AC-6 | ✅ | Calls `generate_multi_week_meal_plans` from Epic 7 |
| AC-7 | ✅ | Emits `MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated` evento event |
| AC-8 | ✅ | Returns JSON with first week + navigation links |
| AC-9 | ✅ | InsufficientRecipes returns 400 with counts + action link |
| AC-10 | ✅ | AlgorithmTimeout returns 500 with retry message |
| AC-11 | ❌ | **Integration tests missing** |

**9/11 ACs satisfied** (82% coverage)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current State:**
- ✅ Code compiles successfully (`cargo build --lib`)
- ✅ Structured logging with tracing::instrument
- ❌ **Zero integration tests for this story**
- ❌ No unit tests for helper functions (`load_favorite_recipes`, `load_user_preferences`, `build_multi_week_response`)
- ❌ No error scenario tests (AC-11 subtasks: 401 Unauthorized, 400 InsufficientRecipes, 500 timeout)

**Missing Test Scenarios (from AC-11):**
1. POST with valid JWT → 200 OK with correct JSON structure
2. Verify `MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated` event emitted (using `unsafe_oneshot`)
3. Verify read model projections (meal_plans, meal_assignments, shopping_lists tables)
4. Verify first week has 21 meal assignments (7 days × 3 meals)
5. POST without JWT → 401 Unauthorized
6. POST with < 7 favorite recipes → 400 InsufficientRecipes
7. Simulate algorithm timeout → 500 response

**Test Coverage Target**: Story requires >85% line coverage (Dev Notes line 116)

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Strengths:**
- Follows evento event-sourced CQRS pattern correctly
- Proper layering: Route → Domain Logic → Evento Event → Projection (implicit)
- Consistent with existing route patterns (`meal_plan.rs`)
- Appropriate use of Axum extractors (State, Extension)
- Error handling with `ApiError` enum and `IntoResponse` trait

**⚠️ Observations:**
- JWT authentication relies on existing middleware (correct pattern)
- Database queries use read pool pattern from AppState
- No transaction management (acceptable for read-only operations + evento event emission)
- Evento event emission uses correct `create().data().metadata().commit()` pattern

### Security Notes

**✅ Security Controls:**
- JWT cookie authentication enforced via middleware
- SQL injection protected via SQLx parameterized queries
- No user input directly exposed in queries
- Appropriate error messages (no internal details leaked)

**⚠️ Recommendations:**
1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limiting for this expensive endpoint (referenced in Dev Notes but not implemented)
2. **Input Validation**: Consider validating `user_id` format (UUID) at route entry
3. **Error Information Disclosure**: Current error responses are appropriate (helpful without leaking internals)

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack Detected:**
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum 0.8 + SQLx + Evento 1.5 + Tokio
- **Auth**: JWT (jsonwebtoken 10.1)
- **DB**: SQLite with evento event sourcing

**Best Practices Applied:**
- ✅ Async/await patterns with Tokio runtime
- ✅ Structured logging with tracing and OpenTelemetry spans
- ✅ Serde for JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Error handling with custom error types and `Into Response`
- ✅ Domain-driven design (evento events, read models)
