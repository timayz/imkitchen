## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

From [architecture.md](../architecture.md):

**Event-Driven Authentication Flow:**
1. User submits registration form → POST /auth/register
2. Registration command emits UserRegistered event
3. Command handler validates email uniqueness asynchronously
4. Emits UserRegistrationSucceeded or UserRegistrationFailed
5. Query handler updates user projection
6. Polling endpoint returns success/failure template

**JWT Cookie Pattern:**
- Token lifetime: 7 days with sliding window refresh
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
- Token payload: { user_id, is_admin, exp }
- Middleware verifies signature and populates Extension<User>

**Database Tables:**

users table (queries.db):
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_admin BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    is_suspended BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

user_emails table (validation.db):
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_emails (
    email TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Security Requirements

From [architecture.md](../architecture.md#security-architecture):
- **Password Hashing**: Argon2id algorithm (OWASP recommended) with auto-generated salt
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters (extend with uppercase, lowercase, number in validation)
- **JWT Security**: HTTP-only cookies with SameSite=Strict attribute
- **CSRF Protection**: Double-submit cookie pattern for state-changing operations

From [CLAUDE.md](/home/snapiz/projects/github/timayz/imkitchen/CLAUDE.md#command-guidelines):
- Commands MUST use input struct as first argument, metadata as second
- NEVER use projections in commands (eventually consistent)
- Async validation deferred to command handlers
- Metadata must include user_id (optional) and request_id (ULID)

### Twinspark Polling Pattern

Registration flow with async validation:
1. User submits form → UserRegistered event emitted immediately
2. Return pending template with polling setup: `ts-req="/auth/register/status/{user_id}" ts-trigger="load delay 1s"`
3. Pending template shows "Creating account, please wait..."
4. Command handler processes validation in background
5. Polling endpoint checks user status in projection
6. Returns success template (redirect to dashboard) or error template (back to form)

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

No context file available - implemented from story requirements and architecture documentation.

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Debug Log References

Implementation completed in single continuous session following event-driven architecture patterns from CLAUDE.md.

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**

Successfully implemented complete JWT cookie-based authentication system with event-driven registration flow. All core functionality is operational and compiles without errors.

**Key Implementation Decisions:**

1. **Event Flow**: Registration uses async validation pattern with UserRegistered → (validation) → UserRegistrationSucceeded/Failed events
2. **JWT Storage**: HTTP-only cookies with SameSite=Strict for XSS protection
3. **Password Security**: Argon2id hashing with auto-generated salts per OWASP recommendations
4. **Polling Pattern**: Twinspark-based polling (1s interval) for registration status during async email validation
5. **Database Separation**: Strict CQRS with separate validation.db and queries.db as per architecture
6. **Template Rendering**: Manual Template::render() due to askama_web compatibility - works correctly

**All Tasks Complete:**

All 8 tasks completed including comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate.

**Completed Follow-up Work:**

- ✅ JWT secret externalized to configuration system (config/default.toml with AuthConfig)
- ✅ Routes integrated into server.rs with complete database initialization and event subscription setup
- ✅ All clippy warnings resolved (validation_pool removed from Command struct, unnecessary casts removed, test helper updated)
- ✅ Application compiles successfully with zero warnings
- ✅ Templates refactored to use base.html template inheritance
- ✅ TwinSpark script path updated to /static/js/twinspark.min.js
- ✅ Dependencies updated: jsonwebtoken 10.1 with aws_lc_rs feature, password-hash with getrandom feature
- ✅ Login handler updated to always return status 200 with HTML (no REST API error codes)
- ✅ Login form updated with TwinSpark attributes for AJAX submission (with ts-req-selector)
- ✅ Clippy warning properly fixed by refactoring (not suppressed) per CLAUDE.md guidelines
- ✅ Login success uses ts-location header to redirect to "/" (TwinSpark-compatible)
- ✅ Registration success uses ts-location header to redirect to "/auth/login" (TwinSpark-compatible)
- ✅ Routes refactored to follow architecture.md structure (routes/auth/ directory with register.rs and login.rs)
- ✅ Error handling follows security best practices (internal errors logged with tracing::error!, generic messages shown to users)
- ✅ Password complexity validation implemented (uppercase, lowercase, number requirements)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite implemented - 9 tests covering all ACs with 100% pass rate:
  - User registration with valid credentials
  - Registration validation (invalid email, weak password, password complexity)
  - Email uniqueness enforcement
  - Login success/failure scenarios
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - All tests use evento::unsafe_oneshot for synchronous event processing
  - Tests follow event-driven flow: command → events → projection → assert
  - Zero clippy warnings

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Jonathan
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

This story implements a comprehensive JWT cookie-based authentication system with event-driven registration following CQRS patterns. The implementation quality is **excellent** - clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, secure password hashing (Argon2id), and zero clippy warnings. However, **Task 8 (comprehensive tests) is completely missing**, which is a critical blocker for approval. Per CLAUDE.md standards and the dev agent's core principles, stories cannot be approved without tests that verify all acceptance criteria.

### Key Findings

#### HIGH SEVERITY

1. **NO TESTS FOR AUTHENTICATION FUNCTIONALITY** (AC #8 NOT MET)
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify that any acceptance criteria are actually met
   - **Evidence:** `cargo test` shows 0 authentication tests, only 4 infrastructure tests
   - **Location:** `tests/` directory missing `auth_test.rs`
   - **Required:** All 8 test subtasks in Task 8 must be implemented
   - **Rationale:** From CLAUDE.md standards and Dev Agent persona: "I implement and execute tests ensuring complete coverage of all acceptance criteria, I do not cheat or lie about tests, I always run tests without exception, and I only declare a story complete when all tests pass 100%."

2. **SECURITY VERIFICATION GAPS** (Due to missing tests)
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify email uniqueness enforcement, password validation, JWT security
   - **Evidence:** No tests for:
     - Email uniqueness validation (prevents duplicate registrations)
     - Password strength requirements (min 8 chars)
     - JWT token expiration handling
     - Suspended user login prevention
     - Protected route access control
   - **Risk:** High - authentication is a critical security boundary

3. **STORY STATUS INCORRECT**
   - **Impact:** Story marked "review" but does not meet Definition of Done
   - **Evidence:** Task 8 explicitly marked incomplete, Completion Notes acknowledge "tests not implemented"
   - **Required:** Story should remain "in-progress" until all tasks complete

#### MEDIUM SEVERITY

4. **MISSING CONTEXT FILES**
   - **Impact:** Development proceeded without story context or tech spec
   - **Evidence:**
     - Dev Agent Record states "No context file available"
     - No tech-spec-epic-1*.md found
     - No story-1.2*.context.xml found
   - **Risk:** Medium - may lead to inconsistencies with broader epic architecture
   - **Note:** Implementation appears correct despite this gap

5. **PASSWORD VALIDATION INCOMPLETE**
   - **Impact:** Current validation only checks min 8 characters
   - **Evidence:** `RegisterUserInput` validator only has `#[validate(length(min = 8))]`
   - **Expected:** Architecture.md#Security-Architecture specifies: "minimum 8 characters (extend with uppercase, lowercase, number in validation)"
   - **Location:** `crates/imkitchen-user/src/command.rs:19`

#### LOW SEVERITY

6. **QUERY FUNCTION COMPLEXITY**
   - **Impact:** Minor - `get_user_status()` has commented workaround
   - **Evidence:** `src/queries/user.rs:169` - "This would require evento access, which we don't have in query functions"
   - **Current Behavior:** Returns "pending" status instead of checking aggregate
   - **Risk:** Low - polling will eventually catch success/failure states

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Status | Evidence | Tests |
|----|--------|----------|-------|
| 1. User aggregate with evento events | ✅ Met | `crates/imkitchen-user/src/` contains aggregate, events (UserRegistered, UserLoggedIn) | ❌ None |
| 2. Registration validates email/password | ✅ Met | `command.rs:16-21` - validator with email format, min 8 chars | ❌ None |
| 3. JWT cookie authentication | ✅ Met | `src/auth/jwt.rs`, `src/auth/middleware.rs` - JWT generation, metadata pattern | ❌ None |
| 4. Login returns JWT in HTTP-only cookie | ✅ Met | `src/routes/auth/login.rs:115-119` - SameSite=Strict cookie | ❌ None |
| 5. Protected routes verify JWT | ✅ Met | `src/auth/middleware.rs:22-55` - middleware extracts user_id | ❌ None |
| 6. Askama templates for forms | ✅ Met | `templates/pages/auth/register.html`, `templates/pages/auth/login.html` | ❌ None |
| 7. User projection table | ✅ Met | `migrations/queries/20251101000000_users.sql` - users table with required fields | ❌ None |
| 8. Tests verify registration/login/access | ❌ **NOT MET** | **NO TESTS EXIST** | ❌ **BLOCKER** |

**Summary:** 7/8 ACs have implementation, but **0/8 have tests**. AC #8 is completely missing.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current Coverage:** 0% (no authentication tests exist)

**Required Coverage (Task 8):**
- [ ] Registration with valid email/password
- [ ] Registration failure: invalid email format
- [ ] Registration failure: weak password
- [ ] Login with correct credentials
- [ ] Login failure: incorrect password
- [ ] Protected route access with valid JWT
- [ ] Protected route redirect when JWT missing
- [ ] Email uniqueness prevents duplicate registration

**Test Infrastructure Status:**
- ✅ Database helpers exist (`tests/database_helpers.rs`)
- ✅ Configuration helpers exist (`tests/configuration.rs`)
- ❌ No `tests/auth_test.rs` file created
- ❌ No test implementation for any authentication flows

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **EXCELLENT** - Implementation follows CLAUDE.md patterns precisely:

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
- ✅ Proper CQRS separation (write DB: evento.db, read DB: queries.db, validation DB: validation.db)
- ✅ Commands use evento::create/save correctly
- ✅ Async validation deferred to command handlers (`on_user_registered`)
- ✅ Query handlers build projections from events
- ✅ Subscriptions use `.skip<>()` for unhandled events

**Security Architecture:**
- ✅ Argon2id password hashing (OWASP compliant)
- ✅ JWT HTTP-only cookies with SameSite=Strict
- ✅ Generic error messages (security best practice) in login.rs:90, register.rs:70
- ⚠️ Password validation needs uppercase/lowercase/number requirements (Architecture.md#Security-Architecture)

**Code Organization:**
- ✅ Bounded context structure (`crates/imkitchen-user/`)
- ✅ Route handlers in `src/routes/auth/` directory
- ✅ Query handlers in `src/queries/user.rs`
- ✅ Proper module organization

### Security Notes

**Implemented Correctly:**
- Password hashing: Argon2id with auto-generated salts
- JWT security: HTTP-only cookies, proper signature validation
- SQL injection prevention: Parameterized queries throughout
- XSS prevention: Askama escapes by default
- Error handling: Generic messages for security (no information leakage)
- Logging: Comprehensive with `tracing` crate

**Requires Verification via Tests:**
- Email uniqueness enforcement (validation DB race conditions?)
- Password verification edge cases
- JWT expiration handling
- Suspended user login prevention
- Token validation error scenarios

**Enhancement Needed:**
- Password complexity validation (uppercase, lowercase, number) - Architecture.md requirement

### Best-Practices and References

**Frameworks & Versions:**
- ✅ Axum 0.8+ route parameters use `{id}` format (correct in all handlers)
- ✅ axum-extra Form/Query extractors used (register.rs:9, login.rs:11)
- ✅ evento 1.5+ with proper CQRS patterns
- ✅ Twinspark polling pattern for async registration

**Standards Compliance:**
- ✅ CLAUDE.md command pattern (input struct first, metadata second)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md query pattern (no evento access in queries)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md event handler pattern (idempotent, <10s execution)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md logging (extensive use of `tracing` macros)
- ❌ CLAUDE.md testing requirements (**NOT MET** - tests missing)

**References:**
- [CLAUDE.md Testing Guidelines](file:///home/snapiz/projects/github/timayz/imkitchen/CLAUDE.md#testing-guidelines)
- [Architecture.md Security Architecture](file:///home/snapiz/projects/github/timayz/imkitchen/docs/architecture.md#security-architecture)

### Action Items

1. **[HIGH] Implement Task 8: Comprehensive Authentication Tests** (AC #8)
   - **Owner:** Dev
   - **Related:** All ACs require test verification
   - **Tasks:**
     - Create `tests/auth_test.rs` with database setup helpers
     - Test: User can register with valid email and password
     - Test: Registration fails with invalid email format
     - Test: Registration fails with weak password (and add password complexity validation)
     - Test: User can login with correct credentials
     - Test: Login fails with incorrect password
     - Test: Protected route accessible with valid JWT
     - Test: Protected route redirects when JWT missing
     - Test: Email uniqueness validation prevents duplicate registration
   - **Verification:** `cargo test` must show 8+ passing tests for authentication
   - **Blocker:** Story CANNOT be approved without tests

2. **[MEDIUM] Add Password Complexity Validation**
   - **Owner:** Dev
   - **Related:** AC #2, Architecture.md#Security-Architecture
   - **Change:** Update `RegisterUserInput` validator to require uppercase, lowercase, and number
   - **Location:** `crates/imkitchen-user/src/command.rs:16-21`
   - **Test:** Update registration tests to verify complexity requirements

3. **[LOW] Create Story Context for Future Stories**
   - **Owner:** SM
   - **Related:** Epic 1 stories should reference tech spec and context
   - **Note:** Current implementation is correct, but future stories would benefit from context files

4. **[LOW] Improve get_user_status Query Function**
   - **Owner:** Dev
   - **Related:** AC #8 (async registration flow)
   - **Current:** Returns "pending" without checking aggregate status
   - **Enhancement:** Consider adding aggregate status check for failed registrations
   - **Location:** `src/queries/user.rs:151-177`
   - **Priority:** Low - current polling mechanism works correctly
