# Story 2.11: Tech Debt & Enhancements

**Status**: Done

## Story

As a **development team**,
I want **to address deferred technical improvements from Stories 2.1 and 1.7**,
so that **code quality, test coverage, and documentation meet production standards**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **[Story 2.1 - HIGH]** Instruction reordering UI implemented with drag handles or up/down arrows
   - Users can reorder instruction steps in recipe form
   - Step numbers update dynamically after reordering
   - TwinSpark or minimal JavaScript provides smooth UX
   - Changes persist on form submission

2. **[Story 2.1 - HIGH]** Complete test suite written: unit tests for RecipeAggregate, integration tests for HTTP routes, E2E tests for recipe creation flow with Playwright
   - Unit tests: RecipeAggregate event handlers and validation logic (`crates/recipe/tests/recipe_tests.rs`)
   - Integration tests: HTTP routes (GET /recipes/new, POST /recipes, GET /recipes/:id) with database projections (`tests/recipe_integration_tests.rs`)
   - E2E tests: Full recipe creation flow from form submission to detail page display (`e2e/tests/recipe.spec.ts`)
   - Target 80% code coverage via `cargo tarpaulin`

3. **[Story 2.1 - MEDIUM]** Form parsing refactored to use Axum extractors
   - Replace `parse_recipe_form()` function with `Form<CreateRecipeForm>` extractor in `src/routes/recipes.rs:292-340`
   - Implement custom deserializer for array fields (ingredient_name[], ingredient_quantity[], ingredient_unit[], instruction_text[])
   - Remove manual URL decoding logic
   - Validation errors returned via Axum's structured error handling

4. **[Story 2.1 - MEDIUM]** Structured error handling implemented with AppError enum
   - Define `AppError` enum with variants: DatabaseError, ValidationError, EventStoreError, RecipeLimitError
   - Implement `IntoResponse` trait for AppError to render user-friendly error pages
   - Map domain errors (RecipeError) to HTTP status codes (422 Unprocessable Entity, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error)
   - Update all recipe routes to use AppError instead of generic Result types

5. **[Story 1.7 - LOW]** Stripe setup guide documented in `docs/stripe-setup.md` or README
   - Document how to obtain Stripe test API keys
   - Document how to create Stripe Price object for $9.99/month subscription
   - Document webhook registration and endpoint secret configuration
   - Link from main README.md to setup guide

6. All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
   - `cargo test` passes all unit and integration tests
   - `playwright test` passes all E2E tests
   - No test failures in GitHub Actions workflow

7. Code coverage metrics meet or exceed 80% target (NFR requirement)
   - Run `cargo tarpaulin` to generate coverage report
   - Recipe domain crate achieves ≥80% line coverage
   - Recipe routes achieve ≥80% branch coverage
   - Coverage report uploaded to CI artifacts

8. Documentation reviewed and approved by tech lead
   - Stripe setup guide reviewed for accuracy and completeness
   - Code refactoring changes reviewed for maintainability
   - Test coverage gaps identified and documented if any

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on domain logic in `crates/recipe/` - event handlers, validation, business rules
- **Integration Tests**: Verify HTTP routes, database projections, and evento event subscriptions work end-to-end
- **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright to test user journeys from browser perspective (form submission, page navigation, data persistence)
- **Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage per NFR requirements (specified in PRD Non-Functional Requirements)

**Form Handling Best Practices:**
- Axum `Form<T>` extractor provides type-safe form parsing with automatic validation
- Use `serde` derives for deserialization and `validator` derives for field-level validation
- Custom deserializers needed for HTML array inputs (e.g., `ingredient_name[]` → Vec<String>)
- Reference: [Axum forms documentation](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/extract/struct.Form.html)

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- AppError enum centralizes error handling across all routes
- `IntoResponse` implementation maps errors to appropriate HTTP status codes and user-friendly HTML pages
- Domain errors (e.g., RecipeError::RecipeLimitExceeded) map to HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity
- Infrastructure errors (e.g., DatabaseError) map to HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- Reference: Story 1.5 uses similar error handling pattern for user profile routes

**TwinSpark Progressive Enhancement:**
- Instruction reordering can use TwinSpark `ts-action` attribute for AJAX-style updates
- Alternative: Minimal vanilla JavaScript for drag-and-drop without external libraries
- Ensure graceful degradation: form submission works without JavaScript enabled

### Source Tree Components to Touch

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified project structure:**
- Tests organized per Rust conventions: unit tests in `crates/*/tests/`, integration tests in `/tests/`, E2E in `/e2e/`
- Error handling centralized in `src/error.rs` following DRY principle
- Documentation in `/docs/` directory (Stripe guide joins existing tech specs)
- No conflicts detected with existing architecture patterns

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Cargo workspace supports shared test utilities via `[dev-dependencies]`
- Playwright configured in `/e2e/` with TypeScript (existing E2E framework from Story 1.7)
- Tarpaulin coverage tool generates HTML reports for local review and CI artifacts
