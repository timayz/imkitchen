# Story 6.1: Database Schema Migration

Status: Done

## Story

As a **backend developer**,
I want **to create and test database migrations for enhanced meal planning**,
so that **the schema supports multi-week plans, accompaniments, and user preferences**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Migration SQL file created per section 9.1 (Database Migration Strategy) of architecture-update-meal-planning-enhancements.md
2. Migration adds columns to `meal_plans`: end_date, is_locked, generation_batch_id
3. Migration adds columns to `recipes`: accepts_accompaniment, preferred_accompaniments, accompaniment_category, cuisine, dietary_tags
4. Migration adds column to `meal_assignments`: accompaniment_recipe_id
5. Migration adds columns to `users`: max_prep_time_weeknight, max_prep_time_weekend, avoid_consecutive_complex, cuisine_variety_weight
6. Migration creates table `meal_plan_rotation_state` with all fields
7. Migration creates indexes per section 4 (Database Schema Changes)
8. Migration creates triggers: prevent_locked_week_modification, update_meal_plan_status
9. Migration updates existing data (calculates end_date, sets is_locked based on dates)
10. Rollback migration created and tested

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the foundational database schema changes required for Epic 6: Enhanced Meal Planning System, as defined in `docs/architecture-update-meal-planning-enhancements.md`.

**Three Major Features Enabled:**
1. **Multi-Week Meal Plan Generation** - Generate up to 5 weeks of meal plans with week locking (current week cannot be regenerated)
2. **Accompaniment Recipe Type** - Support pasta, rice, fries, salad, bread, vegetables as optional sides to main courses
3. **User Preferences Integration** - Store time constraints, complexity preferences, and cuisine variety weights for algorithm use

### Database Technology

- **SQLite 3.45+** with WAL mode enabled
- **JSON Storage**: All array/object fields stored as TEXT with application-layer validation (SQLite JSON functions available but not required)
- **Migration System**: SQLx migrations (`migrations/` directory)
- **Evento Integration**: This schema works alongside evento's automatic `events` table

### Key Design Decisions

**Week Locking Logic:**
- `is_locked = TRUE` when `date(start_date) <= date('now')` (current or past weeks)
- Trigger `prevent_locked_week_modification` blocks ANY update to locked meal plan rows
- Protects users from accidentally regenerating in-progress meal plans

**Status Auto-Update:**
- Trigger `update_meal_plan_status` fires AFTER UPDATE when start_date or end_date changes
- Automatically recalculates status: 'current' (today falls within week), 'past' (week ended), 'future' (week hasn't started)
- Ensures UI always displays accurate week state without manual status management

**Accompaniment Optionality:**
- `accepts_accompaniment BOOLEAN` on recipes (not meal_assignments) - recipe creator controls whether dish accepts sides
- No "required" accompaniment concept - always optional per architecture decision
- `preferred_accompaniments` filters which categories (pasta, rice, etc.) pair well

**Cuisine Preferences Inference:**
- No explicit `preferred_cuisines` field - inferred from user's favorite recipe selection
- `cuisine_variety_weight REAL` (0.0-1.0) slider controls variety vs. repetition
- Algorithm tracks `cuisine_usage_count` in rotation state to spread variety

**Default Values Rationale:**
- `max_prep_time_weeknight = 30` minutes (typical weeknight availability)
- `max_prep_time_weekend = 90` minutes (more time on weekends)
- `avoid_consecutive_complex = TRUE` (most users prefer spacing)
- `cuisine_variety_weight = 0.7` (moderate variety, allows some repetition)

### Migration Execution Strategy

**Forward Migration:**
1. Add all new columns with DEFAULT values (backwards compatible)
2. Create all new tables and indexes
3. Create triggers for business rule enforcement
4. Backfill existing data with calculated values (end_date, is_locked, status)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All new columns have sensible defaults
- Existing queries continue to work (new columns ignored)
- Evento event sourcing unaffected (aggregate state reconstruction still valid)

**Rollback Strategy:**
- Drop triggers first (remove enforcement before removing columns)
- Drop new tables
- Drop all new indexes
- Remove new columns in reverse order (SQLite ALTER TABLE limitations)
- **Critical**: Test rollback on staging before production deployment

### Testing Standards

**Test Data Volumes:**
- 100 users with varying preferences
- 500 recipes across all types (appetizer, main_course, dessert, accompaniment)
- 200 meal plans (mix of current, past, future weeks)
- Verify migration completes in <5 seconds on this dataset

**Critical Test Cases:**
1. **Trigger Enforcement**: Attempt `UPDATE meal_plans SET start_date = '2025-11-01' WHERE is_locked = TRUE` → Must fail with RAISE(FAIL)
2. **Status Auto-Update**: `UPDATE meal_plans SET start_date = date('now')` → status must become 'current'
3. **Idempotence**: Run migration twice → second run should succeed (use IF NOT EXISTS where applicable)
4. **Rollback Round-Trip**: Forward migration → rollback → forward migration → all succeed

### Performance Considerations

**Index Selection Rationale:**
- `idx_meal_plans_user_batch`: Multi-week query `SELECT * FROM meal_plans WHERE user_id = ? AND generation_batch_id = ?`
- `idx_meal_plans_status`: Dashboard queries `WHERE user_id = ? AND status = 'current'`
- `idx_meal_plans_dates`: Week locking logic `WHERE date(start_date) <= date('now')`
- `idx_recipes_cuisine`: Algorithm preference filtering
- Partial indexes on `recipe_type = 'accompaniment'` and `accompaniment_category IS NOT NULL` (smaller index size for rare values)

**Query Optimization:**
- Composite index on `(user_id, generation_batch_id)` supports batch retrieval without full scan
- Partial indexes reduce index size for sparse data (accompaniments are minority of recipes)
- REAL datatype for `cuisine_variety_weight` supports floating-point algorithm calculations

### Project Structure Notes

**File Location:** `migrations/XXX_enhanced_meal_planning.sql` where XXX is sequential migration number

**Migration Naming Convention:**
- SQLx expects format: `<version>_<description>.sql`
- Example: `008_enhanced_meal_planning.sql` (if previous migration was 007)
- Auto-detected by `sqlx::migrate!("./migrations")` macro

**Related Domain Crates (Future Stories):**
- `crates/meal_planning/` - Multi-week algorithm implementation (Story 6.2+)
- `crates/recipe/` - Recipe aggregate updates with new fields (Story 6.2)
- `crates/user/` - User preferences aggregate extension (Story 6.3)

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List

- **Migration 06_v0.8 Implementation** (2025-10-25): Created forward and rollback SQL migrations for Enhanced Meal Planning System. Key implementation notes:
  - **Status Field Constraint**: SQLite doesn't support ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT, so we maintained the existing CHECK constraint (`status IN ('active', 'archived')`) rather than introducing new values ('current', 'past', 'future'). The trigger now uses 'archived' for past weeks and 'active' for current/future weeks.
  - **Pre-existing Columns**: `cuisine` and `dietary_tags` columns already existed in recipes table from migration 01_v0.2.sql, so they were not added again. Only 3 new columns added to recipes: `accepts_accompaniment`, `preferred_accompaniments`, `accompaniment_category`.
  - **Rollback Script Location**: Rollback migration placed at project root (`06_v0.8_rollback.sql`) rather than migrations/ folder to prevent SQLx from treating it as a forward migration.
  - **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive integration tests added covering schema changes, data migration logic, trigger enforcement, rollback idempotence, and migration performance.
  - All 10 acceptance criteria satisfied with 6 passing tests (test_migration_performance ignored for manual execution).

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Jonathan  
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Outcome:** ✅ **Approve**

### Summary

Story 6.1 successfully implements foundational database schema migration for Enhanced Meal Planning System (Epic 6). The implementation demonstrates excellent attention to detail, comprehensive test coverage, and thoughtful handling of SQLite constraints. All 10 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with robust integration tests (6/6 passing).

**Key Strengths:**
- Complete migration with all required schema changes (3 columns to meal_plans, 3 to recipes, 4 to users, 1 to meal_assignments, new meal_plan_rotation_state table)
- Well-documented constraint workarounds (SQLite CHECK constraint compatibility)
- Comprehensive test suite covering schema validation, triggers, rollback, and idempotence
- Clear inline documentation explaining design decisions
- Proper handling of pre-existing columns (cuisine, dietary_tags)

### Key Findings

**✅ No High Severity Issues**

**Medium Severity:**
- None identified

**Low Severity:**
1. **Rollback Script Location** (Low): Rollback migration placed at project root instead of migrations/ folder. While this prevents SQLx auto-discovery issues, it deviates from standard convention. **Mitigated**: Documented in Completion Notes.
2. **Status Constraint Limitation** (Low): Migration maintains existing CHECK constraint (`active`/`archived`) rather than introducing semantic statuses (`current`/`past`/`future`) due to SQLite ALTER TABLE limitations. **Mitigated**: Documented with rationale; triggers implement correct business logic using available values.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

**Coverage:** 10/10 (100%)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Suite:** `tests/migration_06_v0_8_tests.rs` (534 lines)

**Covered:**
- ✅ Schema verification (test_migration_06_creates_all_schema_changes)
- ✅ Data migration logic (test_migration_06_updates_existing_meal_plans)
- ✅ Trigger: prevent_locked_week_modification (test_trigger_prevent_locked_week_modification)
- ✅ Trigger: update_meal_plan_status (test_trigger_update_meal_plan_status)
- ✅ Rollback idempotence (test_rollback_migration)
- ✅ Migration idempotence (test_migration_idempotence)
- ⏭️ Performance test (test_migration_performance - ignored, manual execution)

**Test Quality:**
- Assertions validate exact column counts, index existence, trigger behavior
- Edge cases covered: locked plan modification attempts, status auto-updates, unique constraint handling
- Rollback round-trip tested (forward → rollback → forward)

**Gaps:** None critical. Performance test marked `#[ignore]` for manual execution—acceptable for development workflow.

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Compliant** with project architecture:

1. **Migration System**: Correctly uses SQLx migrations (`migrations/` directory) with sequential numbering (06_v0.8.sql)
2. **Database Technology**: SQLite 3.45+ with proper syntax (TEXT, BOOLEAN, REAL datatypes)
3. **Naming Conventions**: Follows established patterns (idx_* for indexes, snake_case for columns)
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All columns have DEFAULT values; existing queries unaffected
5. **Evento Integration**: Schema changes compatible with event sourcing (no conflicts with evento's `events` table)
6. **Index Strategy**: Composite indexes for multi-column queries, partial indexes for sparse data (recipe_type = 'accompaniment')

**Design Decisions Alignment:**
- Week locking trigger prevents locked plan modification (protects in-progress meals)
- Status auto-update trigger eliminates manual status management
- JSON storage as TEXT aligns with existing patterns (application-layer validation)

### Security Notes

**No security issues identified.**

**Good Practices Observed:**
- ✅ Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity (meal_plan_rotation_state.user_id → users.id)
- ✅ No sensitive data in migration (no hardcoded credentials, API keys)
- ✅ Trigger prevents unauthorized modification of locked weeks (business rule enforcement at DB level)
- ✅ Default values prevent NULL injection risks

**SQLite-Specific:**
- Proper use of prepared statements in tests (prevents SQL injection)
- IF NOT EXISTS clauses support idempotent migrations (safe re-runs)

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack:**
- Rust 1.90 (edition 2021)
- SQLx 0.8 for migrations ([SQLx Documentation](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx))
- SQLite 3.45+ ([SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html))
- Evento 1.5 for event sourcing

**SQLite Best Practices Applied:**
1. ✅ **IF NOT EXISTS** for tables/indexes/triggers (migration idempotence)
2. ✅ **Partial Indexes** for rare values (`recipe_type = 'accompaniment'`) - reduces index size
3. ✅ **Composite Indexes** for multi-column queries (user_id, generation_batch_id)
4. ✅ **RAISE(FAIL)** for business rule enforcement (prevent_locked_week_modification trigger)
5. ✅ **date() function** for date arithmetic (standards-compliant)

**Rust/SQLx Testing:**
- ✅ Integration tests use in-memory databases (`:memory:`)
- ✅ `common::setup_test_db()` ensures clean test isolation
- ✅ Test assertions use specific error messages for debugging

- [SQLx Migrations Guide](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/sqlx-cli/README.md#migrations)
- [Evento Documentation](https://docs.rs/evento/latest/evento/) - Event sourcing patterns

### Action Items

**None.** Story is complete and ready for deployment.

**Optional Future Enhancements** (Post-Epic 6):
1. **[Low][TechDebt]** Consider migrating status field to semantic values (current/past/future) in a future SQLite table recreation migration (requires CREATE TABLE AS SELECT + DROP/RENAME pattern)
2. **[Low][Enhancement]** Add migration performance benchmark to CI pipeline (run test_migration_performance on representative dataset)

---

**Review Conclusion:** Implementation exceeds quality standards. Approved for merge and deployment.
