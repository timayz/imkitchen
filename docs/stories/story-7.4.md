# Story 7.4: Single Week Generation

Status: Done

## Story

As a **meal planning system**,
I want to **generate a complete week's meal plan**,
so that **users receive 21 meal assignments (7 days × 3 courses) respecting all constraints**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Function `generate_single_week` implemented
2. Generates 21 assignments (7 days × 3 courses)
3. Assigns: appetizer, main (with optional accompaniment), dessert per day
4. Appetizer/dessert rotation (can repeat after exhausting full list)
5. Main course uses `select_main_course_with_preferences`
6. Accompaniment assigned if `accepts_accompaniment=true`
7. `RotationState` updated after each assignment (marks used recipes)
8. Returns `WeekMealPlan` with `status=Future`, `is_locked=false`
9. Unit tests cover full week generation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Week Generation Flow:**
```
1. Pre-filter recipes by dietary restrictions (Story 7.1)
2. Separate by type: appetizers, main_courses, desserts, accompaniments
3. Loop through 7 days (Mon-Sun):
   a. Select appetizer (cyclic rotation, reset if exhausted)
   b. Select main course (preference-aware, never repeat)
   c. Pair accompaniment if main accepts
   d. Select dessert (cyclic rotation, reset if exhausted)
   e. Update RotationState
4. Construct WeekMealPlan with 21 assignments
```

**Rotation Rules:**
- **Main Courses:** NEVER repeat (uniqueness enforced across all weeks)
- **Appetizers/Desserts:** CAN repeat after exhausting full list (reset logic)
- **Accompaniments:** CAN repeat freely (not tracked)

**Error Handling:**
- `Error::InsufficientRecipes` - Not enough recipes to generate week
- `Error::NoCompatibleRecipes` - No main course meets constraints for specific day

**Date Calculations:**
```rust
use chrono::{NaiveDate, Duration};

let monday = week_start_date; // Must be Monday
for day_offset in 0..7 {
    let date = monday + Duration::days(day_offset);
    let day_of_week = date.weekday(); // Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.
    // Generate assignments for this date
}
```

### Project Structure Notes

**File Location:**
- `crates/meal_planning/src/algorithm.rs` - Week generation logic
- `crates/meal_planning/src/rotation.rs` - RotationState (Epic 6 Story 6.5)

**Data Models:**
```rust
pub struct WeekMealPlan {
    id: String,                    // UUID
    user_id: UserId,
    start_date: Date,              // Monday
    end_date: Date,                // Sunday
    status: WeekStatus,            // Future | Current | Past | Archived
    is_locked: bool,
    generation_batch_id: String,   // UUID (links multi-week plans)
    meal_assignments: Vec<MealAssignment>,  // 21 items
    shopping_list_id: String,      // Generated in Story 7.6
    created_at: DateTime,
}

pub struct MealAssignment {
    id: String,                    // UUID
    meal_plan_id: String,
    date: Date,
    course_type: CourseType,       // Appetizer | MainCourse | Dessert
    recipe_id: RecipeId,
    accompaniment_recipe_id: Option<RecipeId>,
    prep_required: bool,           // If recipe has advance prep
}

pub enum CourseType {
    Appetizer,
    MainCourse,
    Dessert,
}

pub enum WeekStatus {
    Future,
    Current,
    Past,
    Archived,
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- `chrono` for date manipulation
- `uuid` for ID generation
- `evento` for event emission (Story 7.5 integration)

### Testing Standards

**Test Data Setup:**
- Create test recipes: 10 appetizers, 15 main courses, 10 desserts
- Vary complexity, cuisines, time constraints
- Test with UserPreferences variations

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Full week with sufficient recipes
2. Appetizer/dessert exhaustion and reset
3. Main course exhaustion mid-week (error case)
4. Accompaniment pairing
5. RotationState mutations verified
6. WeekMealPlan structure validation

**Integration with Rotation:**
- Use real RotationState (not mock)
- Verify state changes persist across days

### Test Coverage and Quality

**Test Suite:** `test_single_week_generation.rs` (810 lines, 14 tests)

**Coverage Analysis:**
- ✅ **Happy Path:** Full week generation with sufficient recipes
- ✅ **Edge Cases:** Insufficient main courses, non-Monday start date, exactly 7 mains
- ✅ **Rotation Logic:** Appetizer/dessert cycling and reset, main course uniqueness
- ✅ **Integration:** Accompaniment pairing, rotation state mutations
- ✅ **Performance:** <1 second for 50 recipes (AC-9 target met)
- ✅ **Metadata:** Correct dates, status=Future, is_locked=false

**Test Quality Observations:**
- Well-organized with descriptive test names mapping to ACs
- Comprehensive helper functions (`create_test_recipe`, `create_quick_main_course`, `create_balanced_recipes`)
- Proper assertions with clear failure messages
- Tests properly isolated (fresh RotationState per test)
- Performance test validates P95 latency target

**All Package Tests:** ✅ 176 tests passing (meal_planning crate)

### Architectural Alignment

**Design Patterns:**
- ✅ **Pure Function:** No I/O, deterministic (UUIDs/timestamps handled internally)
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns:** Week generation delegates to specialized functions (Stories 7.2, 7.3)
- ✅ **Mutation Tracking:** RotationState properly updated throughout generation
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Returns `Result<WeekMealPlan, MealPlanningError>` with descriptive errors

**Integration Points:**
- ✅ `select_main_course_with_preferences` (Story 7.2) - Correctly called with all required parameters
- ✅ `select_accompaniment` (Story 7.3) - Properly integrated for main courses
- ✅ `RotationState` (Story 6.5) - State mutations follow documented patterns
- ✅ `RecipeComplexityCalculator` - Used for complexity tracking

**Tech Spec Compliance:**
- ✅ **Data Models:** Matches `WeekMealPlan` and `MealAssignment` structures (Tech Spec Section 3.1)
- ✅ **Rotation Rules:** Main courses never repeat, appetizers/desserts cycle with reset (Section 2.5)
- ✅ **Week Structure:** Monday-Sunday, 21 assignments, status=Future (Section 3.4)
- ✅ **Performance:** <1 second target met (Section 5.1 AC-9)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Logic Flow:** Sequential day-by-day generation with inline AC comments
2. **Proper Validation:** Monday check (AC-9), sufficient main courses check
3. **Defensive Programming:** Fallback logic for appetizer/dessert selection
4. **Good Documentation:** Rustdoc with examples, AC mapping, performance notes
5. **Helper Function:** `day_of_week_to_string()` improves reasoning text readability

**Areas for Enhancement (Low Priority):**

1. **[Low] Appetizer/Dessert Selection:** Currently uses "first available" (line 894, 986)
   - **Issue:** Deterministic selection may produce less variety
   - **Suggestion:** Consider random selection from available set (similar to `select_accompaniment`)
   - **Impact:** Minor - current approach is predictable and meets AC-4
   - **File:** `algorithm.rs:893-904, 985-996`

2. **[Low] Empty user_id Field:** WeekMealPlan sets `user_id = String::new()` (line 1025)
   - **Issue:** Caller must remember to set user_id; risk of empty value persisting
   - **Suggestion:** Add `user_id: UserId` parameter to function signature OR document requirement more prominently
   - **Impact:** Minor - documented in comment, will be caught in Story 7.5 integration
   - **File:** `algorithm.rs:1025`

3. **[Low] Test Maintenance:** Some tests create custom recipe sets (e.g., `test_appetizer_rotation_with_reset`)
   - **Issue:** Duplication of recipe creation logic across tests
   - **Suggestion:** Consider extracting to test fixtures module if test suite grows
   - **Impact:** Minimal - current approach is clear and maintainable
   - **File:** `test_single_week_generation.rs:249-289`

### Security Review

**✅ No Security Issues Identified**

- No user input directly processed (all inputs come from internal domain layer)
- No SQL injection risk (uses evento event sourcing, not raw SQL in this function)
- No secret management concerns
- UUID generation uses secure `uuid` crate
- No authentication/authorization concerns (handled at API layer in Epic 8)

### Best Practices and References

**Tech Stack Detected:**
- Rust 2021 edition
- `chrono` for date handling (NaiveDate, Duration)
- `uuid` for ID generation
- `evento` event sourcing framework (SQLite backend)
- `rand` for randomization (accompaniment selection)

**Rust Best Practices Followed:**
- ✅ Proper error handling with `Result<T, E>` and `?` operator
- ✅ Borrowing and ownership patterns correct (refs for read-only data)
- ✅ Iterator chains for filtering (idiomatic Rust)
- ✅ Rustdoc comments with examples and links
- ✅ `#[cfg(test)]` module for unit tests
- ✅ No `unwrap()` in production code (all Options properly handled)

**References:**
- [Rust Error Handling](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html) - Properly implemented
- [Chrono Date Manipulation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/) - Correct usage of NaiveDate, Duration, Weekday
- [Evento CQRS Pattern](https://docs.rs/evento/latest/evento/) - Prepared for event emission in Story 7.5

### Action Items

**None Required for Story Completion**

Story 7.4 is production-ready as implemented. Optional enhancements below are marked as future improvements:

#### Optional Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

1. **[Enhancement][Low]** Consider random appetizer/dessert selection for improved variety
   - **Context:** Current "first available" approach is deterministic but predictable
   - **Scope:** `algorithm.rs:893-904, 985-996`
   - **Related AC:** AC-4 (still satisfied with current approach)
   - **Owner:** TBD (backlog item for Epic 7 refinements)

2. **[Enhancement][Low]** Add `user_id` parameter to `generate_single_week()` signature
   - **Context:** Eliminate empty `user_id` field in WeekMealPlan
   - **Scope:** `algorithm.rs:812-817, 1025`
   - **Related Story:** Story 7.5 (Multi-Week Generation) can address during integration
   - **Owner:** Story 7.5 implementer

3. **[TechDebt][Low]** Extract test fixtures to separate module if test suite grows
   - **Context:** Recipe creation helpers duplicated across some tests
   - **Scope:** `test_single_week_generation.rs`
   - **Trigger:** If test file exceeds 1000 lines or more test files added
   - **Owner:** TBD
