# Story 9.1: Create Multi-Week Calendar Component

Status: Approved

## Story

As a frontend developer,
I want to build multi-week calendar view with tabs/carousel,
so that users can see and navigate between weeks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Askama template created at `templates/meal_plan/multi_week_calendar.html`
2. Template displays week tabs (Week 1, Week 2, etc.) with date ranges (e.g., "Week 1 (Oct 28 - Nov 3)")
3. Current week tab highlighted with distinct styling (border, background color) and lock icon ðŸ”’
4. Clicking week tab triggers TwinSpark request: `ts-req="/plan/week/:week_id"` with `ts-target="#calendar-content"` and `ts-swap="innerHTML"`
5. Mobile view displays carousel with swipe navigation instead of tabs (progressive enhancement)
6. Each week displays 7-day grid with breakfast/lunch/dinner slots (Monday-Sunday order)
7. Meal slots show: recipe name, image thumbnail, prep time with icon
8. Styling uses Tailwind CSS 4.1+ utility classes with 8px spacing grid
9. Keyboard navigation between weeks using Tab key and Enter to select
10. Responsive design: Desktop (tabs), Mobile (carousel with left/right arrows)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

- **Server-Side Rendering:** Use Askama templates for compile-time checked, SEO-friendly HTML
- **Progressive Enhancement:** TwinSpark for partial updates, degrades gracefully without JavaScript
- **Event-Sourced Read Models:** Template consumes `WeekReadModel` from evento projections
- **Mobile-First Design:** Implement responsive breakpoints with Tailwind CSS utilities

### Source Tree Components

**Templates:**
- `templates/meal_plan/multi_week_calendar.html` - Main calendar component (create new)
- `templates/meal_plan/meal_slot.html` - Individual meal slot partial (may need to create)
- `templates/layout/base.html` - Base layout with TwinSpark script inclusion (existing)

**Backend Routes (Epic 8):**
- `GET /plan` - Returns full multi-week calendar page
- `GET /plan/week/:week_id` - Returns partial HTML fragment for week content

**Read Models:**
- `WeekReadModel` - Contains week data: id, start_date, end_date, status, is_locked, meal_assignments
- `MealAssignmentView` - Contains meal data: date, course_type, recipe, prep_required

**Styling:**
- Tailwind CSS 4.1+ configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- Custom CSS for complex layouts in `static/css/custom.css` (minimal)

### Testing Standards

- **Integration Tests:** Playwright for end-to-end user flow testing
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, contrast ratios)
- **Performance:** First Contentful Paint <1.5s on mobile 3G
- **Browser Compatibility:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

### TwinSpark Integration Pattern

```html
<button ts-req="/plan/week/{{week.id}}"
        ts-target="#calendar-content"
        ts-swap="innerHTML"
        ts-req-method="GET"
        class="tab-button">
  Week {{week_number}} ({{week.start_date}} - {{week.end_date}})
</button>

<div id="calendar-content">
  <!-- Week content rendered here, replaced by TwinSpark -->
</div>
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Template Location:** `templates/meal_plan/multi_week_calendar.html`
- Follows existing template structure pattern
- Integrates with Axum route handlers returning `Html<String>`

**Static Assets:** `static/`
- `static/css/tailwind.css` - Compiled Tailwind CSS
- `static/js/twinspark.js` - TwinSpark library (~10KB)

**Route Handler Pattern:**
```rust
pub async fn get_multi_week_calendar(
    State(state): State<AppState>,
    user: User,
) -> Result<Html<String>, AppError> {
    let weeks = query_all_weeks(&state.db, &user.id).await?;
    let template = MultiWeekCalendarTemplate { weeks, current_week_id };
    Ok(Html(template.render()?))
}
```
