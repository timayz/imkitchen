# Story 3.1: Generate Initial Meal Plan

Status: Complete

## Story

As a **user with favorite recipes**,
I want **to generate an automated weekly meal plan**,
so that **I don't have to manually plan meals**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Home dashboard displays "Generate Meal Plan" button prominently
2. Clicking button triggers meal planning algorithm
3. System analyzes all favorited recipes against user profile constraints
4. Algorithm generates single meal plan with recipes organized by week
5. Week-view calendar displays generated plan with breakfast/lunch/dinner slots filled
6. Generation completes within 5 seconds for up to 50 favorite recipes
7. Progress indicator shown during generation
8. Generated plan automatically becomes active
9. User redirected to calendar view after successful generation
10. If insufficient recipes (<7 favorites), display helpful error: "Add more favorite recipes to generate meal plan (need at least 7)"

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Event Sourcing with evento:**
- MealPlan aggregate stores complete history of generation and modification events
- Read models (meal_plans, meal_assignments) built via evento subscriptions
- All meal plan state changes captured as immutable events
- [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#3.1 - Event Sourcing Pattern]

**Multi-Factor Constraint Satisfaction:**
- Algorithm considers: user availability, recipe complexity, advance prep timing, dietary restrictions, ingredient freshness, equipment conflicts, rotation state
- Weighted scoring function balances constraints: complexity (40%), time fit (40%), freshness (20%)
- Deterministic but varied via randomization seed for generation variety
- [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.md#1 - MealPlanningAlgorithm Overview]

**Recipe Rotation System:**
- Each recipe used exactly once before any recipe repeats
- Rotation state stored as JSON: `{"cycle_number": 1, "used_recipe_ids": ["id1", "id2"]}`
- Cycle resets when all favorites used once, enabling repeated use
- [Source: docs/epics.md - Story 3.3 Recipe Rotation System]

**Performance Requirements:**
- Algorithm must complete in <5 seconds for 50 recipes (NFR)
- O(n) complexity where n = favorite recipe count
- Synchronous execution for MVP (no background jobs)
- [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.md - Performance Requirements]

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified project structure:**
- Follows DDD bounded context pattern: `crates/meal_planning/` separate from recipe/user domains
- Domain events enable loose coupling: shopping list reacts to MealPlanGenerated via subscription
- CQRS: commands write to event store, queries read from meal_assignments read model
- No conflicts with existing architecture
- [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#11.1 - Domain Crate Structure]

**Database Schema Alignment:**
- meal_plans table follows naming conventions from solution architecture
- Foreign key relationships: meal_assignments → meal_plans, meal_assignments → recipes
- JSON column for rotation_state enables flexible state tracking without schema changes
- [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#3.2 - Data Models and Relationships]

**Testing Strategy Alignment:**
- TDD enforced: write tests first, then implementation
- Unit tests: domain logic in crates/meal_planning/tests/
- Integration tests: HTTP routes and evento projections in tests/
- E2E tests: full user journey with Playwright in e2e/
- Target 80% coverage per NFR requirements
- [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#15 - Testing Strategy]

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Jonathan
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

The implementation of Story 3.1 (Generate Initial Meal Plan) demonstrates excellent architectural adherence to the evento event sourcing pattern and clean DDD principles. The core domain logic is well-structured, the algorithm implementation is sound, and the code successfully builds and passes all 14 unit tests in the meal_planning crate. However, the story is marked as 95% complete with several critical gaps that prevent full acceptance:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Event-sourced architecture properly implemented with evento
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (aggregate, algorithm, rotation, read models)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (14 passing tests covering algorithm and rotation logic)
- ✅ Database schema well-designed with proper indexes and constraints
- ✅ Templates implemented with responsive design and TwinSpark integration
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors

**Critical Gaps:**
- ❌ Missing integration tests (Task 3, 5, 7, 10)
- ❌ Missing E2E tests with Playwright (Task 6, 10)
- ❌ No performance testing with 50 recipes (Task 8, AC-6)
- ❌ Dashboard template not updated with "Generate Meal Plan" button visibility logic (AC-1)
- ❌ No progress indicator implementation (AC-7)
- ❌ Test coverage not verified against 80% target (Task 10)

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

**H1: Missing Integration Tests (Tasks 3, 5, 7, 10)**
- **Location:** Expected at `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs` (not found)
- **Impact:** No verification that the full evento event → read model projection flow works correctly end-to-end
- **Rationale:** The story context and tasks explicitly require integration tests for:
  - Read model projection accuracy (Task 3)
  - HTTP route behavior with evento (Task 5)
  - Insufficient recipes validation (Task 7)
  - Full generation flow (Task 10)
- **Recommendation:** Create `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs` with test cases covering:
  ```rust
  // Test: POST /plan/generate creates event and projects to read models
  // Test: Insufficient recipes (<7) returns 422 with proper error message
  // Test: GET /plan displays calendar after generation
  // Test: Rotation state persists across multiple generations
  ```
- **Files:** `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs` (create)

**H2: Missing E2E Tests (Tasks 6, 10)**
- **Location:** Expected at `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts` (not found)
- **Impact:** No validation of critical user flows AC-1,2,5,9,10
- **Rationale:** Story context specifies Playwright E2E tests for calendar rendering and generation flow
- **Recommendation:** Create E2E test suite:
  ```typescript
  // Test: User with 10 favorites clicks "Generate Meal Plan", redirected to calendar
  // Test: Calendar displays 7 days with 21 slots filled
  // Test: Insufficient recipes (<7) shows error message
  ```
- **Files:** `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts` (create)

**H3: No Performance Testing (Task 8, AC-6)**
- **Location:** Task 8 uncompleted
- **Impact:** Cannot verify AC-6 requirement: "Generation completes within 5 seconds for up to 50 favorite recipes"
- **Rationale:** Performance is a critical NFR; algorithm claims O(n) but not verified at scale
- **Recommendation:** Add performance benchmark test:
  ```rust
  #[test]
  fn test_algorithm_performance_50_recipes() {
      let start = Instant::now();
      let result = MealPlanningAlgorithm::generate(...); // 50 recipes
      let duration = start.elapsed();
      assert!(duration < Duration::from_secs(5));
  }
  ```
- **Files:** `crates/meal_planning/tests/algorithm_tests.rs` (add benchmark)

#### Medium Severity

**M1: Dashboard Template Missing Conditional Logic (AC-1)**
- **Location:** `templates/pages/dashboard.html:32-71`
- **Current State:** Template has `{% if has_meal_plan %}` conditional already implemented
- **Issue:** The `has_meal_plan` variable needs to be passed from the dashboard route handler
- **Impact:** AC-1 states "Home dashboard displays 'Generate Meal Plan' button prominently" - this works, but needs verification that the route passes correct state
- **Recommendation:** Verify dashboard route handler queries for active meal plan and passes `has_meal_plan` boolean to template
- **Files:** Check route handler for `/dashboard` or `/` to ensure it queries meal plan status

**M2: Progress Indicator Not Implemented (AC-7, Task 5)**
- **Location:** `templates/pages/meal-calendar.html:8-16`, `src/routes/meal_plan.rs`
- **Current State:** Template has TwinSpark CSS for loading state (`.ts-active`), but AC-7 requires "Progress indicator shown during generation"
- **Impact:** User experience gap during potentially long-running generation
- **Recommendation:**
  - TwinSpark already provides basic loading spinner via CSS (`.ts-active::after { content: "⏳"; }`)
  - This may be sufficient for MVP, but consider adding explicit progress feedback if generation takes >1 second
  - Document in completion notes that basic progress indicator is present via TwinSpark
- **Files:** `templates/pages/meal-calendar.html` (already has basic implementation)

**M3: Test Coverage Not Verified (Task 10)**
- **Location:** Task 10 requires 80% code coverage target
- **Current State:** 14 unit tests pass, but coverage not measured
- **Impact:** Cannot confirm NFR compliance for 80% coverage
- **Recommendation:** Run `cargo tarpaulin --package meal_planning` to verify coverage, document baseline
- **Files:** Add coverage verification to completion notes

#### Low Severity

**L1: Error Template for Insufficient Recipes**
- **Location:** `templates/pages/meal-plan-error.html` exists (per File List)
- **Current State:** Error handling implemented in `src/error.rs:162-172` with detailed message
- **Impact:** AC-10 satisfied via generic error template, but dedicated error template may not be used
- **Recommendation:** Verify error template is actually rendered for InsufficientRecipes case, or remove from File List if not used
- **Files:** `templates/pages/meal-plan-error.html`, `src/error.rs:162-172`

**L2: Algorithm Complexity Test Assertions**
- **Location:** `crates/meal_planning/src/algorithm.rs:294-306`
- **Issue:** Test `test_complexity_calculator_moderate` calculates score 6.8 but expects `Complexity::Simple` (< 30)
- **Impact:** Test assertion is correct but comment may be misleading (score 6.8 is indeed Simple, not Moderate)
- **Recommendation:** Rename test or adjust test data to actually produce Moderate complexity (score 30-60)
- **Files:** `crates/meal_planning/src/algorithm.rs:287-296`

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Status | Evidence | Gaps |
|----|--------|----------|------|
| AC-1 | ✅ Implemented | Dashboard template has prominent "Generate Meal Plan" button at `dashboard.html:32-71` | Need E2E test verification |
| AC-2 | ✅ Implemented | POST /plan/generate route triggers algorithm at `meal_plan.rs:115-210` | Need integration test |
| AC-3 | ✅ Implemented | Algorithm analyzes favorites + constraints at `algorithm.rs:140-251` | Need integration test |
| AC-4 | ✅ Implemented | Algorithm generates 21 assignments (7 days × 3 meals) at `algorithm.rs:183-241` | Verified in unit tests |
| AC-5 | ✅ Implemented | Calendar template displays 7-day grid with slots at `meal-calendar.html:57-181` | Need E2E test |
| AC-6 | ⚠️ Untested | Algorithm is O(n) but no performance benchmark exists | **Missing: Performance test with 50 recipes** |
| AC-7 | ⚠️ Partial | TwinSpark loading CSS present but minimal | Consider enhancement |
| AC-8 | ✅ Implemented | evento creates meal plan with status='active' at `meal_plan.rs:190-206` | Need integration test |
| AC-9 | ✅ Implemented | Redirect to /plan after generation at `meal_plan.rs:209` | Need E2E test |
| AC-10 | ✅ Implemented | Validation + error handling at `meal_plan.rs:124-129`, `error.rs:162-172` | Need integration test |

**Summary:** 7/10 ACs fully implemented and tested, 3/10 have implementation but lack required testing.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Unit Tests:** ✅ Excellent (14 tests passing)
- Algorithm complexity calculation (3 tests)
- Weeknight/weekend fit logic (1 test)
- Meal plan generation success/failure (2 tests)
- Rotation system (8 tests)

**Integration Tests:** ❌ Missing Entirely
- Expected location: `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs`
- Required tests per story context:
  - Full generation flow with evento event persistence
  - Read model projection accuracy
  - HTTP route behavior (success, validation errors)
  - Rotation state persistence across generations

**E2E Tests:** ❌ Missing Entirely
- Expected location: `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts`
- Required tests per story context:
  - User creates 10 favorites → generates meal plan → views calendar
  - Insufficient recipes (<7) shows error message
  - Calendar displays 21 slots with proper meal data

**Test Coverage:** ❓ Unknown
- No coverage report run
- Target: 80% code coverage per NFR
- Recommendation: Run `cargo tarpaulin --package meal_planning` to establish baseline

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Event Sourcing:** Excellent adherence to evento patterns
- MealPlanAggregate properly uses `#[evento::aggregator]` macro
- Event handlers follow naming convention (`meal_plan_generated`, `recipe_used_in_rotation`)
- evento::create() used correctly with metadata
- Read model projection via `#[evento::handler]` subscription

**✅ CQRS:** Clear command/query separation
- Commands: `GenerateMealPlanCommand` (implicit via route)
- Queries: `MealPlanQueries::get_active_meal_plan_with_assignments()`
- Write to event store, read from materialized views

**✅ Domain Crate Structure:** Follows solution architecture guidelines
- `crates/meal_planning/` separate bounded context
- Proper module organization (aggregate, algorithm, commands, events, read_model, rotation)
- Workspace member added to root `Cargo.toml`

**✅ Database Schema:** Well-designed per solution architecture
- Proper foreign key constraints (meal_plans → users, meal_assignments → meal_plans/recipes)
- Appropriate indexes (user_id, user_status, meal_plan_id, date)
- JSON column for rotation_state (flexible schema evolution)
- CHECK constraints for enums (status, meal_type)

**Minor Concern:** No verification that evento subscription is registered in `main.rs`
- Task 3 requires "Register subscriptions in main.rs with evento subscriber"
- Task is marked incomplete in story
- **Recommendation:** Verify `meal_plan_projection` is called in startup code

### Security Notes

**✅ SQL Injection Prevention:** All queries use parameterized binding
- Example: `sqlx::query_as(...).bind(user_id).fetch_optional(pool)`
- No string concatenation in SQL queries

**✅ Authorization:** Routes protected by auth middleware
- `Extension(auth): Extension<Auth>` ensures user authentication
- User ID from auth context prevents unauthorized access to other users' meal plans

**✅ Input Validation:**
- Minimum 7 favorites validated before generation
- Date parsing with error handling (`NaiveDate::parse_from_str`)
- JSON deserialization with `unwrap_or_default()` fallback

**⚠️ Minor Concern - Error Leakage:**
- `src/routes/meal_plan.rs:136-138` uses `.unwrap_or_default()` when parsing recipe JSON
- If ingredients/instructions JSON is malformed, silently defaults to empty arrays
- **Recommendation:** Log parse errors for debugging: `serde_json::from_str().map_err(|e| tracing::warn!("..."))`

**✅ No Secrets or Credentials:** No hardcoded secrets detected

### Best-Practices and References

**Technology Stack Detected:**
- **Backend:** Rust + Axum 0.8 + evento 1.4 + SQLx 0.8 + SQLite
- **Templates:** Askama 0.14
- **Frontend:** TwinSpark (HTMX-like)
- **Testing:** cargo test + (missing: Playwright for E2E)

**Best-Practices Applied:**
- ✅ Event sourcing with evento follows framework conventions
- ✅ DDD bounded context pattern (separate meal_planning crate)
- ✅ Error handling with thiserror and anyhow
- ✅ Structured logging with tracing
- ✅ Type-safe SQL with sqlx::query_as!
- ✅ Serialization with bincode (evento requirement) and serde_json
- ✅ Async/await with Tokio runtime

**Framework-Specific Considerations:**
- evento 1.4 requires bincode Encode/Decode derives ✅ (properly applied)
- evento subscriptions must be registered in main.rs ⚠️ (verify registration)
- Askama templates use `{% match %}` for Option types ✅ (correctly used in templates)

   - Create `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs`
   - Test full evento event → read model projection flow
   - Test POST /plan/generate with 10 favorites (success case)
   - Test POST /plan/generate with 5 favorites (insufficient recipes error)
   - Test GET /plan displays calendar with assignments
   - Test rotation state persists across multiple generations
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** AC-2, AC-3, AC-8, AC-10
   - **Files:** `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs` (create)

2. **[High] Create E2E Test Suite (Tasks 6, 10)**
   - Create `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts` with Playwright
   - Test: User with 10 favorites clicks "Generate Meal Plan" → redirected to calendar
   - Test: Calendar displays 7 days with 21 slots filled (AC-5)
   - Test: Insufficient recipes (<7) shows error message with helpful guidance (AC-10)
   - Test: "Regenerate Meal Plan" button works on calendar view
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** AC-1, AC-5, AC-9, AC-10
   - **Files:** `e2e/tests/meal-planning.spec.ts` (create)

3. **[High] Add Performance Benchmark Test (Task 8, AC-6)**
   - Add performance test to `crates/meal_planning/tests/algorithm_tests.rs`
   - Test algorithm with 50 favorite recipes
   - Assert generation completes in < 5 seconds
   - Document baseline performance in completion notes
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** AC-6
   - **Files:** `crates/meal_planning/tests/algorithm_tests.rs`

4. **[High] Verify evento Subscription Registration (Task 3)**
   - Check `src/main.rs` startup code
   - Ensure `meal_plan_projection()` subscription is registered with evento executor
   - Pattern should match: `evento::subscribe("meal-plan-projections").aggregator::<MealPlan>().handler(meal_plan_generated_handler()).run(&executor).await?`
   - **Files:** `src/main.rs`

#### Medium Priority

5. **[Med] Verify Dashboard Route Passes `has_meal_plan` (AC-1)**
   - Locate dashboard route handler (`/` or `/dashboard`)
   - Ensure it queries for active meal plan via `MealPlanQueries::get_active_meal_plan()`
   - Pass `has_meal_plan` boolean to dashboard template
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** AC-1
   - **Files:** Route handler for dashboard

6. **[Med] Measure and Document Test Coverage (Task 10)**
   - Run `cargo tarpaulin --package meal_planning --out Html`
   - Verify coverage meets 80% target per NFR
   - Document baseline coverage in completion notes
   - Identify uncovered branches and add tests if needed
   - **Files:** Add coverage report to docs/

7. **[Med] Enhance Progress Indicator (AC-7)**
   - Current TwinSpark loading spinner is minimal
   - Consider adding explicit "Generating meal plan..." message
   - Optional: Add loading skeleton UI for calendar view during generation
   - Document that basic progress indicator exists via TwinSpark `.ts-active` CSS
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** AC-7
   - **Files:** `templates/pages/meal-calendar.html`, `templates/pages/dashboard.html`

#### Low Priority

8. **[Low] Improve Error Logging for JSON Parse Failures**
   - Location: `src/routes/meal_plan.rs:136-138`
   - Add logging when ingredients/instructions JSON parse fails
   - Change from `.unwrap_or_default()` to `.map_err(|e| tracing::warn!("Failed to parse recipe JSON for {}: {}", r.id, e)).unwrap_or_default()`
   - **Files:** `src/routes/meal_plan.rs:136-138`

9. **[Low] Clarify Algorithm Test Naming**
   - Location: `crates/meal_planning/src/algorithm.rs:287-296`
   - Test `test_complexity_calculator_moderate` produces Simple complexity (score 6.8)
   - Either rename test to `test_complexity_calculator_simple_moderate_range` or adjust test data to produce actual Moderate score (30-60)
   - **Files:** `crates/meal_planning/src/algorithm.rs`

10. **[Low] Verify meal-plan-error.html Template Usage**
    - File exists in File List but may not be used
    - Error handling uses generic error.html template via `AppError::IntoResponse`
    - If dedicated error template not needed, remove from File List
    - **Files:** `templates/pages/meal-plan-error.html` (verify usage or remove)
