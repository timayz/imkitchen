# Story 9.7: Responsive Design and Accessibility Testing

Status: Approved

**Review Note:** Full Senior Developer Review deferred until Stories 9.1-9.6 (UI implementation) are complete and manual testing tasks can be executed. Automated testing infrastructure is complete and validated.

## Story

As a frontend developer,
I want to ensure all new UI is responsive and accessible,
so that users on mobile and assistive technology can use features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All pages tested on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px) - manual testing log
2. Calendar: Tabs on desktop, carousel on mobile (responsive breakpoint @md:)
3. Forms: Full-width inputs on mobile (w-full), constrained on desktop (max-w-md)
4. Modals: Centered on desktop with backdrop, full-height on mobile
5. Touch targets ≥44x44px on mobile (buttons, checkboxes, links) - WCAG AA compliance
6. Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements (Tab order logical, Enter/Space activate)
7. Screen reader testing: All content accessible with NVDA/VoiceOver (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
8. Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (verified with WAVE tool)
9. Focus indicators visible for all interactive elements (2px border, 4px offset, primary-500 color)
10. Lighthouse accessibility score >90 for all pages (automated test in CI)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

- **Mobile-First Design:** Start with mobile layouts, enhance for larger screens with Tailwind breakpoints
- **WCAG AA Compliance:** Target accessibility level required by law in many jurisdictions
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Features work without JavaScript, enhanced with TwinSpark
- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper HTML5 elements (nav, main, article, section, aside) for screen readers

### Source Tree Components

**Testing Documentation:**
- `docs/testing/epic-9-responsive-test-log.md` - Manual responsive testing log (create)
- `docs/testing/epic-9-accessibility-report.md` - Comprehensive accessibility report (create)

**CI Configuration:**
- `.github/workflows/accessibility.yml` - Lighthouse CI workflow (create or update)
- `lighthouserc.json` - Lighthouse CI configuration (create)

**Templates (Testing Focus):**
- All Epic 9 templates: multi_week_calendar.html, meal_planning_preferences.html, create_recipe.html, shopping_list.html
- Review and fix accessibility issues found during testing

### Testing Standards

- **WCAG AA Compliance:** Industry standard for web accessibility
- **Lighthouse Score >90:** High bar ensuring accessibility quality
- **Manual Testing Required:** Automated tools catch ~40% of accessibility issues
- **Screen Reader Testing:** Essential for understanding user experience with assistive technology

### Testing Tools

**Manual Testing:**
- Browser DevTools (responsive mode, accessibility inspector)
- Real devices (iPhone, Android phone, tablets)
- Ruler tool for measuring touch targets

**Screen Readers:**
- **NVDA** (Windows, free): https://www.nvaccess.org/
- **VoiceOver** (Mac/iOS, built-in): Cmd+F5 to enable
- **JAWS** (Windows, paid): Industry standard for Windows

**Automated Testing:**
- **Lighthouse** (Chrome DevTools): Performance, accessibility, SEO audits
- **WAVE** (Browser extension): Visual contrast and ARIA checker
- **axe DevTools** (Browser extension): Detailed accessibility issues
- **Pa11y** (CLI tool): Automated accessibility testing

**CI Integration:**
- **Lighthouse CI**: Run Lighthouse in CI pipeline, fail on low scores
- **axe-core**: JavaScript library for accessibility testing in Playwright tests

### Responsive Breakpoints (Tailwind CSS)

```
- Mobile:   < 768px  (sm: breakpoint)
- Tablet:   768px - 1024px  (md: breakpoint)
- Desktop:  > 1024px  (lg:, xl:, 2xl: breakpoints)
```

**Tailwind Responsive Utilities:**
- `w-full md:max-w-md` - Full width on mobile, max-width on tablet+
- `flex-col md:flex-row` - Stacked on mobile, horizontal on tablet+
- `text-sm md:text-base` - Smaller text on mobile, normal on tablet+

### WCAG AA Requirements Summary

**1. Contrast Ratios:**
- Normal text (<18pt): 4.5:1 minimum
- Large text (≥18pt or ≥14pt bold): 3:1 minimum
- UI components (buttons, form borders): 3:1 minimum

**2. Touch Targets:**
- Minimum size: 44x44px (WCAG 2.5.5, AAA level)
- Best practice: 48x48px for primary actions

**3. Keyboard Navigation:**
- All functionality available via keyboard
- Visible focus indicators (2px border, 4px offset recommended)
- Logical tab order matching visual flow

**4. Screen Reader Support:**
- Semantic HTML (headings, lists, nav, main)
- ARIA labels for non-obvious elements (icons, complex widgets)
- Form labels associated with inputs (for/id or aria-labelledby)
- Error announcements (aria-live, aria-invalid)

**5. Text Alternatives:**
- Alt text for all informative images
- Empty alt for decorative images (alt="")
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons

### Lighthouse CI Configuration

```json
// lighthouserc.json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "url": [
        "http://localhost:3000/plan",
        "http://localhost:3000/profile/meal-planning-preferences",
        "http://localhost:3000/recipes/new",
        "http://localhost:3000/shopping"
      ],
      "numberOfRuns": 3
    },
    "assert": {
      "assertions": {
        "categories:accessibility": ["error", {"minScore": 0.9}],
        "categories:performance": ["warn", {"minScore": 0.8}],
        "categories:seo": ["warn", {"minScore": 0.9}]
      }
    },
    "upload": {
      "target": "temporary-public-storage"
    }
  }
}
```

### Common Accessibility Issues and Fixes

**Issue: Missing Form Labels**
```html
<!-- Bad -->
<input type="text" name="max_prep_time" />

<!-- Good -->
<label for="max_prep_time">Max prep time (minutes)</label>
<input type="text" id="max_prep_time" name="max_prep_time" />
```

**Issue: Low Contrast Text**
```html
<!-- Bad: text-gray-400 on white (2.5:1 contrast) -->
<p class="text-gray-400">Accompaniment text</p>

<!-- Good: text-gray-600 on white (4.5:1 contrast) -->
<p class="text-gray-600">Accompaniment text</p>
```

**Issue: Missing Focus Indicators**
```css
/* Bad: Browser default focus outline removed */
button:focus { outline: none; }

/* Good: Custom focus indicator with high contrast */
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid theme('colors.primary.500');
  outline-offset: 4px;
}
```

**Issue: Icon-Only Button Without Label**
```html
<!-- Bad: Screen reader announces "button" with no context -->
<button><i class="icon-regenerate"></i></button>

<!-- Good: ARIA label provides context -->
<button aria-label="Regenerate this week">
  <i class="icon-regenerate"></i>
</button>
```
