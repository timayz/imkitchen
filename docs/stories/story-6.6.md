# Story 6.6: Update Read Models and Projections

Status: Done

## Story

As a **backend developer**,
I want **to create evento projection handlers for all new Epic 6 events**,
so that **read models stay in sync with domain events and queries return current state**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Projection handler created for `MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated` event
2. Handler `project_multi_week_meal_plan_generated` inserts all weeks into `meal_plans` table
3. Projection handler created for `RecipeCreated` event extension (new Epic 6 fields)
4. Handler `project_recipe_created` handles new recipe fields (accepts_accompaniment, preferred_accompaniments, accompaniment_category, cuisine, dietary_tags)
5. Projection handler created for `UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated` event (Epic 6 user preferences)
6. Handler `project_user_meal_planning_preferences_updated` updates user preferences columns
7. JSON serialization works for Vec<T> fields stored as TEXT (preferred_accompaniments, dietary_tags, dietary_restrictions)
8. Integration tests verify database updates after evento events
9. Evento subscriptions registered for all new Epic 6 event handlers
10. All tests pass with `unsafe_oneshot` for sync subscription processing

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create projection handler for MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add `project_multi_week_meal_plan_generated` function in `crates/meal_planning/src/read_model.rs`
  - [ ] Iterate over `weeks: Vec<WeekMealPlanData>` from event
  - [ ] Insert each week into `meal_plans` table with fields: id, user_id, start_date, end_date, is_locked, generation_batch_id, status, rotation_state_json, created_at
  - [ ] Insert meal_assignments (21 per week) into `meal_assignments` table with accompaniment_recipe_id field
  - [ ] Calculate week status from dates: Future (start_date > today), Current (start_date <= today <= end_date), Past (end_date < today)
  - [ ] Store rotation_state as JSON string in rotation_state_json column
  - [ ] Add integration test: emit MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated → query meal_plans table → verify all weeks inserted
  - [ ] Add integration test: verify meal_assignments count = weeks × 21

- [ ] Create projection handler for RecipeCreated with Epic 6 fields (AC: 3, 4, 7)
  - [ ] Update existing `project_recipe_created` handler in `crates/recipe/src/read_model.rs`
  - [ ] Add new columns to INSERT: accepts_accompaniment (BOOLEAN), preferred_accompaniments (TEXT JSON), accompaniment_category (TEXT nullable), cuisine (TEXT nullable), dietary_tags (TEXT JSON)
  - [ ] Use `serde_json::to_string()` for Vec<AccompanimentCategory> → TEXT (preferred_accompaniments)
  - [ ] Use `serde_json::to_string()` for Vec<DietaryTag> → TEXT (dietary_tags)
  - [ ] Handle NULL for Option<AccompanimentCategory> and Option<Cuisine>
  - [ ] Add integration test: create recipe with all new fields → query recipes table → verify JSON deserialization works
  - [ ] Add edge case test: create recipe with empty preferred_accompaniments (should store "[]")

- [ ] Create projection handler for UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated (AC: 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Add `project_user_meal_planning_preferences_updated` function in `crates/user/src/read_model.rs`
  - [ ] UPDATE users table columns: max_prep_time_weeknight, max_prep_time_weekend, avoid_consecutive_complex, cuisine_variety_weight, dietary_restrictions (TEXT JSON)
  - [ ] Use `serde_json::to_string()` for Vec<DietaryRestriction> → TEXT (dietary_restrictions)
  - [ ] WHERE clause: user_id = event.user_id
  - [ ] Add integration test: emit UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated → query users table → verify preferences updated
  - [ ] Add integration test: verify dietary_restrictions JSON round-trip (serialize → store → deserialize)

- [ ] Register evento subscriptions for all handlers (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Add subscription for MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated in meal_planning read_model setup
  - [ ] Add subscription for RecipeCreated (enhanced) in recipe read_model setup
  - [ ] Add subscription for UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated in user read_model setup
  - [ ] Use `evento::subscribe("subscription-name").aggregator::<AggregateType>().handler(handler_fn).run(&executor)` pattern
  - [ ] Ensure subscription names unique per handler

- [ ] Write integration tests for all projections (AC: 8, 10)
  - [ ] Test: emit MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated with 3 weeks → query meal_plans → verify 3 rows
  - [ ] Test: emit MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated → query meal_assignments → verify 63 assignments (3 weeks × 21)
  - [ ] Test: verify generation_batch_id links all weeks from same batch
  - [ ] Test: emit RecipeCreated with cuisine="italian" → query recipes → verify cuisine field
  - [ ] Test: emit UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated → query users → verify max_prep_time_weeknight updated
  - [ ] Use `unsafe_oneshot(&executor)` instead of `run(&executor)` for sync subscription processing in tests
  - [ ] All integration tests use in-memory SQLite database
  - [ ] All tests cleanup after execution (drop tables)

- [ ] Add helper functions for JSON serialization (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Add `serialize_to_json<T: Serialize>(value: &T) -> Result<String, serde_json::Error>` in shared_kernel or meal_planning::read_model
  - [ ] Add `deserialize_from_json<T: DeserializeOwned>(json: &str) -> Result<T, serde_json::Error>` helper
  - [ ] Use helpers in all projection handlers for Vec<T> fields
  - [ ] Add unit test: round-trip serialization for Vec<String>, Vec<DietaryTag>, Vec<AccompanimentCategory>

## Dev Notes

**Architecture Context:**

This story completes the CQRS read model infrastructure for Epic 6, ensuring all new domain events update corresponding database tables via evento projections. Read models enable fast queries without loading full event streams.

**Key Business Rules:**

- Projections are eventually consistent (not immediate)
- Multi-week meal plans store each week as separate row in meal_plans table
- generation_batch_id links weeks generated together
- Week status calculated from dates: Future/Current/Past/Archived
- JSON fields (Vec<T>) stored as TEXT for SQLite compatibility

**Technical Constraints:**

- SQLite doesn't have native JSON column type (use TEXT)
- SQLx query macros disabled (compile-time verification off per architecture)
- Use serde_json for Vec<T> serialization to TEXT
- Evento subscriptions process events async by default
- Tests use `unsafe_oneshot` for synchronous event processing (per architecture doc section 13 testing strategy)
- All projections must be idempotent (replaying events produces same state)

**Testing Standards:**

- Integration tests required for all projection handlers
- Use in-memory SQLite for fast test execution
- Test JSON round-trip serialization explicitly
- Verify database state after eventi event emission
- Coverage target: >90% per Story 6.7

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Jonathan
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Outcome:** **Changes Requested**

### Summary

The projection handler implementation is **excellent** with comprehensive coverage of all Epic 6 domain events. Code quality is production-ready with zero critical security or architectural issues. However, **integration tests (AC #8, #10) are missing**, which is a mandatory requirement for verifying projection correctness. The implementation demonstrates strong Rust idioms, proper error handling, and correct CQRS event sourcing patterns.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity
**[High] Missing integration tests (AC #8, #10)**
- **Impact:** Cannot verify projection handlers correctly update database state
- **Evidence:** `crates/meal_planning/tests/multi_week_projection_tests.rs` does not exist
- **Related AC:** #8 (integration tests), #10 (unsafe_oneshot usage)
- **Files:** Tests documented in `meal_planning/src/read_model.rs:708-725` but not implemented

#### Medium Severity
None identified.

#### Low Severity
**[Low] JSON serialization helper functions not created (suggested in tasks, not mandatory AC)**
- **Impact:** Minor code duplication, slightly harder debugging
- **Evidence:** Inline `serde_json::to_string()` used throughout (acceptable Rust idiom)
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding `.map_err()` context to JSON serialization errors for easier debugging

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Description | Status | Evidence |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated handler created | ✅ PASS | `meal_planning/src/read_model.rs:590-693` |
| 2 | Handler inserts all weeks into meal_plans | ✅ PASS | Lines 643-662 (INSERT query), 598-690 (transaction) |
| 3 | RecipeCreated projection for Epic 6 fields | ✅ PASS | `recipe/src/read_model.rs:46-122` |
| 4 | Handler processes new recipe fields | ✅ PASS | Lines 59-116 (all 5 new fields serialized and bound) |
| 5 | UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated handler created | ✅ PASS | `user/src/read_model.rs:354-408` |
| 6 | Handler updates user preferences columns | ✅ PASS | Lines 379-405 (UPDATE all 8 preference fields) |
| 7 | JSON serialization for Vec<T> fields | ✅ PASS | serde_json used correctly across all handlers |
| 8 | Integration tests verify database updates | ❌ FAIL | No test file exists (`multi_week_projection_tests.rs` missing) |
| 9 | Evento subscriptions registered | ✅ PASS | Lines 705, 439, 401 (all handlers registered) |
| 10 | Tests use unsafe_oneshot | ❌ N/A | Cannot verify - no tests implemented |

**Coverage:** 8/10 ACs passing (80%), 2 ACs blocked by missing tests

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current State:**
- ❌ **Zero integration tests** for new projection handlers
- ✅ Test strategy documented correctly in code comments
- ✅ Existing `tests/persistence_tests.rs` provides good reference pattern

**Required Tests (per AC #8):**
1. MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated with 3 weeks → verify 3 rows in `meal_plans`
2. Verify 63 meal assignments created (3 weeks × 21)
3. Verify `generation_batch_id` links weeks correctly
4. RecipeCreated with Epic 6 fields → verify JSON round-trip
5. UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated → verify all preference columns updated
6. All tests must use `unsafe_oneshot(&executor)` for sync processing

**Recommended Test File Structure:**
```
crates/meal_planning/tests/
├── multi_week_projection_tests.rs  (NEW - high priority)

crates/recipe/tests/
├── recipe_epic6_projection_tests.rs  (NEW - medium priority)

crates/user/tests/
├── user_preferences_projection_tests.rs  (NEW - medium priority)
```

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **EXCELLENT** - Perfect alignment with event-sourced CQRS architecture:

**Strengths:**
- Projections correctly transform events → read model state
- Transaction usage ensures atomicity (all-or-nothing batch inserts)
- Event handlers are idempotent (replaying events produces same state)
- Proper separation: domain events (write) vs read models (query)
- Evento subscription pattern correctly implemented
- Week status calculation follows business rules (Future/Current/Past)

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Follows solution-architecture-compact.md CQRS guidelines
- ✅ Uses evento 1.5 framework correctly
- ✅ SQLite TEXT columns for JSON (no native JSON type)
- ✅ Async handlers with proper error propagation

### Security Notes

✅ **SECURE** - No security vulnerabilities identified:

**SQL Injection:**
- ✅ All queries use parameterized bindings via SQLx
- ✅ Zero string concatenation in SQL queries
- ✅ User input never directly interpolated

**Data Integrity:**
- ✅ Transaction rollback on error prevents partial writes
- ✅ Foreign key constraints respected (meal_plan_id)
- ✅ JSON serialization errors propagated (not swallowed)

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages
- ✅ Proper use of `anyhow::Result` for error context
- ✅ Date parsing errors descriptive but safe

### Best-Practices and References

**Rust Best Practices:**
- ✅ Idiomatic async/await with Tokio runtime
- ✅ Proper use of `?` operator for error propagation
- ✅ Type-safe evento handler macro
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with AC references

**Evento/CQRS Patterns:**
- ✅ Event handlers registered via `subscribe().handler()` pattern
- ✅ Projection idempotency maintained
- ✅ Read model optimized for queries (denormalized)
- Reference: [Evento Framework Docs](https://docs.rs/evento/1.5.0)

**Testing Standards:**
- ⚠️ Per architecture doc section 13: `unsafe_oneshot()` required for tests
- ⚠️ Coverage target >90% per Story 6.7 (cannot assess without tests)
- Reference: `docs/solution-architecture-compact.md#469-projection-testing`

### Action Items

1. **[High Priority] Create integration tests for MultiWeekMealPlanGenerated projection (AC #8)**
   - File: `crates/meal_planning/tests/multi_week_projection_tests.rs`
   - Tests: 3 weeks insert, 63 assignments, batch ID linking, rotation state JSON
   - Pattern: Follow `tests/persistence_tests.rs:104-164` structure
   - Use `unsafe_oneshot(&executor)` for sync event processing

2. **[High Priority] Create integration tests for RecipeCreated Epic 6 fields (AC #8)**
   - File: `crates/recipe/tests/recipe_epic6_projection_tests.rs`
   - Tests: Verify all 5 new fields serialized/deserialized correctly
   - Edge case: Empty `preferred_accompaniments` should store `"[]"`

3. **[High Priority] Create integration tests for UserMealPlanningPreferencesUpdated (AC #8)**
   - File: `crates/user/tests/user_preferences_projection_tests.rs`
   - Tests: Verify all 8 preference columns updated
   - Test: `dietary_restrictions` JSON round-trip

4. **[Medium Priority] Add error context to JSON serialization**
   - Files: `meal_planning/src/read_model.rs`, `recipe/src/read_model.rs`
   - Change: `.map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("Failed to serialize RotationState: {}", e))?`
   - Benefit: Easier debugging when JSON serialization fails

5. **[Low Priority] Consider chunking for large batch transactions**
   - File: `meal_planning/src/read_model.rs:590-693`
   - Current: Single transaction for all weeks (acceptable for 5-week limit)
   - Future: If batch size grows beyond 5 weeks, consider chunking inserts
