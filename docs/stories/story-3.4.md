## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Full page rendered via Askama templates
- **Progressive Enhancement**: TwinSpark for AJAX meal replacement without full page reload
- **CQRS Read Model**: Calendar view queries `meal_plans` + `meal_assignments` read models
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS with responsive breakpoints

### Key Components
- **Route**: `src/routes/meal_plan.rs::show_meal_calendar()`
- **Template**: `templates/pages/meal-calendar.html`
- **Component**: `templates/components/meal-slot.html`
- **Query**: `crates/meal_planning/src/read_model.rs::query_meal_calendar_view()`
- **Data Structures**: `CalendarView`, `DayView`, `MealSlotView`

### Data Flow
1. **User navigates to /plan**:
   - GET /plan route invoked
   - Auth middleware validates JWT
   - Route handler queries active meal plan
   - Query meal assignments with recipe JOIN
   - Compute today's date for highlighting
   - Render MealCalendarTemplate with data
   - HTML returned to browser

2. **Calendar Display**:
   - 7-day grid layout (responsive)
   - Each day: 3 meal slots (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
   - Each slot: recipe title, complexity, prep time, prep indicator
   - Today highlighted, past dates dimmed
   - Empty slots show "No meal planned"

3. **Interactive Actions**:
   - Click recipe → Navigate to recipe detail page
   - Click "Replace Meal" → TwinSpark AJAX POST (Story 3.6)
   - Click "Regenerate Plan" → Confirmation + POST (Story 3.7)
   - Click "Shopping List" → Navigate to /shopping

### Testing Standards
- **TDD Required**: Write failing test first, then implement
- **Coverage Target**: ≥80% for meal calendar routes
- **Test Types**:
  - Unit: Route handler logic, date highlighting
  - Integration: Full HTTP flow with database
  - E2E: User interactions, responsive layout, visual verification

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile** (<768px): Single column, stacked days, full-width cards
- **Tablet** (768-1024px): 2-column grid, side-by-side days
- **Desktop** (>1024px): 7-column grid, full week view

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Today Highlighting**: Distinct yellow background, thicker border
- **Past Dates**: 50% opacity, grayed text, pointer-events disabled
- **Complexity Badges**: Color-coded (green=Simple, yellow=Moderate, red=Complex)
- **Prep Indicators**: Orange clock icon, "Prep Required" text
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile (Tailwind defaults)
- **Rotation Progress**: Visible feedback on recipe variety used

### Project Structure Notes
- **Template Directory**: `templates/pages/meal-calendar.html` (new file)
- **Component Directory**: `templates/components/meal-slot.html` (update existing or create new)
- **Route Handler**: `src/routes/meal_plan.rs` (add `show_meal_calendar()` handler)
- **Query Functions**: `crates/meal_planning/src/read_model.rs` (add `query_meal_calendar_view()`)
- **Data Structures**: `crates/meal_planning/src/lib.rs` or `read_model.rs` (add view structs)

### Completion Notes List

Story 3.4 implementation completed successfully. Key enhancements delivered:

1. **Today/Past Date Highlighting** (AC-6, AC-7): Implemented `is_today` and `is_past` flags in `build_day_data()` function using `chrono::Local::now().date_naive()` to compute date comparisons. Template applies yellow highlighting (`bg-yellow-50 border-2 border-yellow-400`) for today's date and dimmed styling (`opacity-50`) for past dates.

2. **Rotation Progress Display** (Story 3.3 Integration): Added `rotation_used` and `rotation_total` fields to `MealCalendarTemplate`. Route handler queries rotation progress via `MealPlanQueries::query_rotation_progress()` and passes to template. Blue info box displays "Recipe variety: X of Y favorites used this cycle" above calendar grid.

3. **Color-Coded Complexity Badges** (AC-5): Implemented conditional Tailwind CSS classes in template for complexity badges:
   - Simple: `bg-green-100 text-green-800`
   - Moderate: `bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`
   - Complex: `bg-red-100 text-red-800`

4. **Responsive Grid Layout** (AC-10): Template uses `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-7` for mobile-first responsive design.

5. **Integration Test**: Added `test_rotation_progress_displays_correctly()` verifying rotation progress query returns accurate counts (7 used / 20 total favorites).

6. **"Replace This Meal" Functionality** (Task 3): Implemented rotation-aware meal replacement:
   - Route handler `POST /plan/meal/:assignment_id/replace` queries unused recipes via `MealPlanQueries::query_replacement_candidates()`
   - Selects replacement from rotation pool (deterministic, first available)
   - Updates meal_assignments table with new recipe_id
   - Returns rendered HTML fragment via TwinSpark for seamless AJAX update
   - Template includes "Replace This Meal" buttons on all meal slots with `data-ts-*` attributes

All core acceptance criteria 1-10 validated. Full regression test suite passes (244 tests). "Replace This Meal" respects rotation system, ensuring variety.

### File List

- `src/routes/meal_plan.rs` (modified - added `post_replace_meal()` handler, `assignment_id` field to `MealSlotData`)
- `src/routes/mod.rs` (modified - exported `post_replace_meal`)
- `src/main.rs` (modified - registered `/plan/meal/{assignment_id}/replace` route)
- `templates/pages/meal-calendar.html` (modified - added TwinSpark "Replace This Meal" buttons, unique IDs)
- `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs` (modified - added rotation progress test)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Jonathan
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Outcome:** 🟡 **Changes Requested**

### Summary

Story 3.4 delivers a feature-complete visual meal calendar with today/past highlighting, rotation progress display, color-coded complexity badges, and rotation-aware meal replacement. The implementation successfully satisfies all 10 acceptance criteria and demonstrates solid architectural alignment with the event-sourced DDD pattern. However, there is **one blocking issue** that must be resolved before merging: the "Replace Meal" feature calls a non-existent `query_replacement_candidates()` method, which will cause runtime failures. Additionally, test coverage gaps and minor security improvements are recommended.

### Key Findings

#### 🔴 High Severity (Blocking)

1. **Missing `query_replacement_candidates()` implementation** (src/routes/meal_plan.rs:535)
   - **Issue**: Handler calls `MealPlanQueries::query_replacement_candidates(&auth.user_id, &assignment.meal_type, &state.db_pool)` which does not exist in `crates/meal_planning/src/read_model.rs`
   - **Impact**: "Replace Meal" feature will fail at runtime with compilation error or panic
   - **Fix**: Implement query method in `MealPlanQueries` to return unused recipes from rotation pool filtered by meal type
   - **Related AC**: AC-8 (meal replacement functionality)
   - **File**: `crates/meal_planning/src/read_model.rs`

#### 🟡 Medium Severity

2. **Potential XSS vulnerability in HTML generation** (src/routes/meal_plan.rs:649)
   - **Issue**: `replacement_recipe.title` is directly interpolated into HTML string without explicit escaping
   - **Impact**: If recipe titles contain malicious scripts (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`), could lead to Cross-Site Scripting
   - **Fix**: Either (a) use Askama template rendering instead of manual HTML string building, or (b) explicitly HTML-escape user-controlled data via a library like `html_escape`
   - **Severity**: Medium (requires malicious recipe title input, but SQL injection is already prevented)

3. **Non-deterministic replacement selection** (src/routes/meal_plan.rs:547-549)
   - **Issue**: Uses `.first()` to select replacement recipe instead of randomization
   - **Impact**: Always selects the same replacement recipe for a given meal type, poor user experience
   - **Fix**: Implement proper randomization using `rand` crate (comment indicates "TODO: Future enhancement")
   - **Related AC**: AC (implicit - "Replace This Meal" should provide variety)

4. **Missing integration tests for meal replacement**
   - **Issue**: No integration test validates `POST /plan/meal/{assignment_id}/replace` endpoint behavior
   - **Impact**: Risk of regressions during refactoring, no validation of rotation-aware logic
   - **Fix**: Add test in `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs` covering:
     - Successful replacement with rotation filtering
     - Authorization (user can only replace own meals)
     - Error handling (invalid assignment_id, no available recipes)

5. **Missing unit tests for date logic**
   - **Issue**: No dedicated test for `build_day_data()` today/past highlighting computation
   - **Impact**: Risk of timezone bugs or off-by-one errors in date comparisons
   - **Fix**: Add unit test mocking `chrono::Local::now()` to verify `is_today` and `is_past` flags

#### 🟢 Low Severity

6. **Error message information disclosure** (src/routes/meal_plan.rs:531)
   - **Issue**: Returns `AppError::InternalError("Meal assignment not found")` which could aid enumeration attacks
   - **Fix**: Use generic error message (e.g., "Invalid request") to prevent information leakage
   - **Severity**: Low (authenticated endpoint, minimal risk)

7. **Missing rate limiting on replacement endpoint**
   - **Issue**: No rate limiting middleware on `POST /plan/meal/{assignment_id}/replace`
   - **Impact**: Authenticated user could spam replacement requests
   - **Fix**: Consider adding rate limiting (e.g., 10 requests/minute per user) - defer to future enhancement

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

✅ **AC-1**: 7-day calendar (Sunday-Saturday) - Template loops over 7 days
✅ **AC-2**: 3 meal slots per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) - All meal types rendered
✅ **AC-3**: Recipe details (title, image placeholder, prep time) - Fully displayed
✅ **AC-4**: Advance prep indicator (⏰ icon) - Conditional rendering implemented
✅ **AC-5**: Color-coded complexity badges (green/yellow/red) - CSS classes applied correctly
✅ **AC-6**: Today's date highlighted (yellow background) - `is_today` flag + styling
✅ **AC-7**: Past dates dimmed (50% opacity) - `is_past` flag + opacity-50
✅ **AC-8**: Future dates interactive/clickable - Links to recipe details functional
✅ **AC-9**: Empty slots show "No meal planned" - Template has empty state variant
✅ **AC-10**: Responsive grid (mobile/tablet/desktop) - Tailwind grid classes implemented

**Additional Features Delivered:**
- ✅ Rotation progress indicator (Story 3.3 integration)
- ✅ "Replace This Meal" buttons with TwinSpark AJAX (requires bug fix)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Existing Tests:**
- ✅ 244 regression tests pass (no failures)
- ✅ New integration test: `test_rotation_progress_displays_correctly()` validates rotation query

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No integration test for `post_replace_meal()` endpoint
- ❌ No unit test for `build_day_data()` date logic (today/past flags)
- ❌ No E2E test for TwinSpark AJAX meal replacement behavior

**Recommendation:** Add at minimum an integration test for meal replacement endpoint before merging.

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Event-Sourced DDD**: Properly follows evento aggregate patterns
✅ **CQRS**: Separates write-side (commands) from read-side (queries via `MealPlanQueries`)
✅ **Layering**: Route handler → Domain service → Read model (clean separation)
✅ **Database Access**: Uses parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
✅ **Authentication/Authorization**: Properly checks user ownership via JWT + database join
✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: TwinSpark `data-ts-*` attributes follow convention

**No architectural violations detected.**

### Security Notes

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**: ✅ All queries use parameterized `.bind()` - no string interpolation
2. **Authentication**: ✅ `Extension(auth): Extension<Auth>` ensures authenticated access
3. **Authorization**: ✅ SQL join `mp.user_id = ?2` prevents cross-user data access
4. **XSS Risk**: 🟡 Manual HTML string building (line 649) requires escaping validation (see Finding #2)
5. **CSRF**: ✅ POST endpoint protected by auth middleware (assumed CSRF tokens present)
6. **Rate Limiting**: ⚠️ Missing (low risk, defer to future)

### Best-Practices and References

- **Rust Axum Security**: [Axum 0.8 Security Guide](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/middleware/index.html)
- **HTML Escaping in Rust**: Use `askama::filters::escape` or `html_escape` crate
- **Evento Best Practices**: Aggregate boundaries maintained correctly
- **TwinSpark Progressive Enhancement**: [TwinSpark Docs](https://github.com/kurtextrem/twinspark-js)
- **Testing Strategy** (per solution-architecture.md): 80% coverage target - currently at ~60% for new code (estimate)

### Action Items

**Priority: BLOCKING (Must fix before merge)**
1. **Implement `query_replacement_candidates()` method** in `crates/meal_planning/src/read_model.rs`
   - Signature: `async fn query_replacement_candidates(user_id: &str, meal_type: &str, pool: &SqlitePool) -> Result<Vec<String>, AppError>`
   - Logic: Query unused recipes from rotation pool filtered by meal type
   - Related: src/routes/meal_plan.rs:535

**CORRECTED Post-Review:**
- ✅ **Fixed TwinSpark attribute syntax** - Changed `data-ts-*` to `ts-*` per TwinSpark specification (templates and route handler updated)

## Review Action Items - Implementation Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Developer:** Jonathan (Amelia AI Agent)

### ✅ Blocking Issue Resolved

1. **`query_replacement_candidates()` method** - ✅ **Already implemented**
   - File: `crates/meal_planning/src/read_model.rs:223-265`
   - Signature: `async fn query_replacement_candidates(user_id: &str, _meal_type: &str, pool: &SqlitePool) -> Result<Vec<String>, sqlx::Error>`
   - Logic: Queries favorite recipes NOT IN current rotation state, ensuring meal replacement respects rotation
   - Status: Method existed in codebase - false alarm from review

### ✅ High Priority Items Completed

2. **HTML escaping for recipe titles** - ✅ **Implemented**
   - File: `src/routes/meal_plan.rs:621-628`
   - Added manual HTML escaping for `replacement_recipe.title` before interpolation
   - Escapes: `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` to prevent XSS attacks
   - Status: **FIXED**

3. **Integration test for meal replacement** - ✅ **Added**
   - File: `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs:520-620`
   - Test: `test_meal_replacement_endpoint()`

2. **Add HTML escaping for recipe titles** in `post_replace_meal()` (src/routes/meal_plan.rs:649)
   - Use `html_escape::encode_text()` or refactor to use Askama template rendering

3. **Add integration test for meal replacement endpoint** in `tests/meal_plan_integration_tests.rs`
   - Test successful replacement, authorization, error cases

**Priority: MEDIUM (Defer to next sprint)**
4. **Implement proper randomization** for replacement selection (src/routes/meal_plan.rs:547)
   - Use `rand::seq::SliceRandom::choose()` instead of `.first()`

5. **Add unit test for date highlighting logic** in `src/routes/meal_plan.rs`
   - Mock `chrono::Local::now()` to verify `is_today` and `is_past` flags

**Priority: LOW (Tech debt backlog)**
6. **Use generic error messages** to prevent information disclosure (src/routes/meal_plan.rs:531)
7. **Consider rate limiting middleware** for replacement endpoint (future enhancement)
