# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Project:** imkitchen
**Analyst:** Jonathan

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application (Progressive Web App)
- **Project Level:** Level 3 (Full Product)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-lg.md

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Intelligent meal planning and cooking optimization platform with automated weekly meal scheduling, detailed preparation guidance, and community-driven recipe discovery. Targets home cooking enthusiasts and busy families who want variety without planning complexity.
- **Estimated Stories:** 20-35 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 3-5 epics
- **Timeline:** 6-9 months to MVP launch

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield (new project)
- **Existing Documentation:** Product Brief (docs/brief.md)
- **Team Size:** Solo developer / small team
- **Deployment Intent:** Production SaaS with freemium model, target 10,000 active users within 6 months

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

1. **PRD.md** - Comprehensive Product Requirements Document with full feature specifications
2. **epics.md** - Epic breakdown for architect handoff to 3-solutioning workflow
3. **Tech handoff to workflow 3-solutioning** - Architect will create detailed technical specifications per epic

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Current Step:** Generate comprehensive PRD using instructions-lg.md
2. **Epic Breakdown:** Create detailed epics for architect handoff
3. **Architect Handoff:** Route to 3-solutioning workflow for technical architecture and implementation specs

### Next Actions

1. Execute PRD workflow with instructions-lg.md
2. Generate full PRD sections iteratively with user approval
3. Create epic breakdown for architect handoff
4. Prepare technical context for 3-solutioning workflow

## Special Considerations

- **Complex Technical Stack:** Rust-based with Axum, evento (event sourcing/CQRS), Askama templates, TwinSpark for reactivity
- **Architectural Patterns:** TDD enforced, DDD with bounded contexts, Event Sourcing, CQRS pattern
- **Mobile-First PWA:** Offline capability required, push notifications, installable app experience
- **Community Features:** Recipe sharing and rating system requires moderation strategy
- **Freemium Model:** 10 recipe limit in free tier driving premium conversion strategy

## Technical Preferences Captured

**Backend:**
- HTTP Server: Axum 0.8+
- Templates: Askama 0.14+ (type-safe)
- Event Sourcing/CQRS: evento 1.3+ (SQLite)
- Database: SQLx 0.8+ (SQLite) WITHOUT compile-time checks
- CLI: Clap 4.5+
- Config: config 0.15+
- Observability: OpenTelemetry 0.31+
- Validation: validator 0.20+
- i18n: rust-i18n 3.1.5

**Frontend:**
- UI Reactivity: TwinSpark (progressive enhancement, avoid JavaScript unless necessary)
- CSS: Tailwind CSS 4.1+
- Design System: Comprehensive component library with consistent patterns

**Testing:**
- E2E: Playwright 1.56+ (TypeScript)
- Methodology: TDD enforced for all features

**Architecture:**
- Monolithic Rust project with workspace crates in `crates/` folder
- DDD bounded contexts per workspace
- Root binary with `serve` and `migrate` commands
- Event-driven architecture within monolith
- Avoid vendor lock-in, prioritize open standards

**Security:**
- OWASP standards for security implementations
- JWT cookie-based authentication
- User data encryption
- GDPR compliance ready
