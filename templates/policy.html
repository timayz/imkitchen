        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          When meal plans are generated, we create snapshots/copies of all referenced recipes (including community

          or modifies their recipe.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          When you delete a shared recipe, it is removed from community search and other users' favorites. However,
          recipe snapshots in previously generated meal plans are preserved for those users.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">5.3 Imported Recipes</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Recipes imported via JSON are stored as private by default. You control whether to share them with the
