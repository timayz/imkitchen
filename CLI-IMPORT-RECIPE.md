}
```

```

### Output

On success, you'll see:
```
âœ… Recipe imported successfully!
   Recipe ID: uuid-here
   User: user@example.com (user-id)
```

## Error Handling

The command will fail with an error message if:
- The JSON file doesn't exist or can't be read
- The JSON format is invalid
- The user email doesn't exist in the database
- Recipe validation fails (missing required fields, title too short/long, etc.)
- Database connection fails

## Notes

- The user must already exist in the database before importing recipes
- The recipe will be automatically tagged with cuisine type and dietary tags based on ingredients
- Complexity level is calculated automatically based on ingredient count and instruction steps
- The recipe is created using the evento event sourcing system, so all changes are tracked in the event store
