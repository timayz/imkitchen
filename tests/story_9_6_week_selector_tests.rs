/// - AC 9.6.3: Current week selected by default
/// - AC 9.6.4: Changing selection triggers TwinSpark request
/// - AC 9.6.5: Dropdown options show week dates
/// - AC 9.6.6: Locked weeks marked with ðŸ”’ icon
/// - AC 9.6.7: Shopping list displays week start date at top
/// - AC 9.6.8: Mobile responsive dropdown (w-full, min-height 44px)
